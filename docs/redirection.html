<p>Also, for the next project meeting, I think it’s probably worthwhile to discuss several concerns I have at this stage.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Right now, I’m focusing on reading about molecular dynamics simulation. However, I’ve been told many times that a lot of the techniques discussed in this book are not related to active matter projects. Do you think it would be better to start reading the references on Zotero instead? There is a lot of material (one book, 21 papers, online resources, as well as code) being presented to me, but it’s not really clear to me what the priority is.</p></li>
<li><p>There were things that I wanted to discuss last week (see <a href="./meetings.html#sec-week8-project-meeting">2024/11/2 Things to discuss</a> and <a href="./notes.html#sec-week8-diary">2024/11/4 Diary</a>), but since not everyone could be present, it was postponed. The notes I wrote on 4 November reflect my feelings about our project and my progress in the PhD. I wonder if these points would be better discussed in the next project meeting before starting the book club meeting.</p></li>

<p>Hi Sohyun,</p>
<p>Thanks for your messages. (I thought I’d move things to email as it is easier for longer conversations).</p>
<p>Happy to talk about your worries at the next meeting. I would just say at the start that I am not currently concerned about your progress. It is normal at the start of a PhD to spend quite a lot of time “getting the lay of the land”. We appreciate that with such a lot of new ideas and concepts that things can sometimes feel overwhelming, and it can be difficult to separate the wood from the trees. Please be reassured that this is normal.</p>
<p>I would also say that it is very positive that you are engaged with a good number of complex concepts and trying to understand them in your own terms. The students who don’t make progress are usually the ones who are not engaged, so again I think you can be reassured.</p>
<p>When it comes to reading papers/books that we have suggested, I just wanted to comment that the way most scientists absorb information is usually not by sitting down, reading a paper from cover to cover and not putting it down until they understand every detail. If we did that, we wouldn’t get anything done. Rather we try to first get a feel for roughly what the message of the paper is talking about, the main ideas if you like, and very often that is as far as it goes. If there is something that we find particularly interesting or relevant we might go into more detail, but I would say that that is the exception. So, if we put papers on Zotero and suggest you look at them, we don’t mean that you need to read and understand everything in great detail. In most cases you might just want to get a rough idea of what a paper is about (AI can help here) and build up some familiarity with the types of approaches and language that are used in the field.</p>
<p>Another comment I would make is that it is not always necessary as a PhD student to be able to derive from first principles the methods and results that underpin your approach. Of course, we need to feel reasonably confident that we are using tried and tested techniques for which the strengths and weakness are known. But often the methods themselves might be based on decades of work drawn from vast fields of literature. If one were not to try to make progress until all the foundations had been thoroughly understood, then there would be little time left to measure things. I think it is quite right and proper that you want to understand where the Langevin or ABP equations of motion comes from and how this translates into a time stepping algorithm for evolving the system. But I don’t think one necessarily needs to go all the way back to Einstein’s original papers to do this. You told me (I think in the context of your project last year) that you felt the need to understand all the foundations before making progress on the project. I would just comment that often we learn ‘on the job’, so to say, ie we might start calculating or measuring without understanding completely what we are doing or why, but the process of ‘doing’ builds that understanding.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope these comments help and we can certainly discuss further next week.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Nigel</p>

<p>It seems my interests have shifted over the summer or possibly during the final stages of my MSci research project. It sort of makes sense when I think about it in terms of the timeline.</p>
<p>In January 2024, when I was applying for my PhD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I wanted to pursue new physics. It appeared to me that two of my favourite fields (general relativity and quantum field theory) were already well-explored and largely complete.</li>
<li>I also wanted to gain more employability skills, as I hoped to work at Google DeepMind after my PhD. I thought a computationally driven project was essential for this.</li>
<li>Eager to formally learn about the renormalisation group, I looked into areas of new physics related to it. That’s when I discovered the emerging field of active matter. After reading Keller’s account of its history and emergence, as well as McGivern’s account of how it relates to cognition (which I should probably revisit tomorrow), I thought, <em>this is it!</em> This was the field I wanted to pursue! I met Nigel, who was such a brilliant and thoughtful person to talk with, and Francesco, who had already been amazing. I applied directly (and, in fact, only applied for this PhD, while my peers were applying for multiple positions).</li>
<li>In my second term, I was also in the process of interviewing with Samsung Electronics, as they invited me to take on a data scientist role (this happened in early January, I think?). The role and salary were very attractive. However, I had to think deeply about what I truly wanted to do. There were still unsolved mysteries I hoped to explore during my PhD. I was curious about fundamental questions like: <em>What is time? What is space?</em> I thought about relativity theory and how Einstein built his ideas around the concept of a universal clock, which doesn’t depend on the mechanisms of the clock itself. But these clocks are also within a gravitational field. Can we truly justify that reading a clock on an observer’s wrist is the correct way to measure time, given that all clocks are fundamentally based on electromagnetism?</li>
<li>So, I decided to stay at university for another four years. Over the summer holidays, I continued reading neuroscience books (particularly on dreams and altered states of consciousness) and considered which topics would be interesting to investigate throughout my PhD.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p>It really makes me reflect on what I’ve been genuinely interested in. From my third year, I started rating how much I enjoyed each unit after finishing it, based on this scale:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5</strong>: I found it very interesting<br>
</li>
<li><strong>4</strong>: Interesting<br>
</li>
<li><strong>3</strong>: Okay<br>
</li>
<li><strong>2</strong>: Not much fun<br>
</li>
<li><strong>1</strong>: I hated it</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the scores for my third-year and fourth-year units:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5</strong>: Quantum Physics / Physics Research Project<br>
</li>
<li><strong>4.5</strong>: Particle Physics, Analytical Mechanics / The Physics of Phase Transitions<br>
</li>
<li><strong>4</strong>: Methods of Theoretical Physics / Foundations of Modern Physics, General Relativity and Cosmology, Quantum Information Theory<br>
</li>
<li><strong>3.5</strong>: Materials Physics</li>
<li><strong>3</strong>: Environmental Physics<br>
</li>
<li><strong>2.5</strong>: Solid State Physics / Applied Materials Physics<br>
</li>
<li><strong>2</strong>: Biophysics</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, how did I end up choosing my PhD project in active matter? There were complex reasons for choosing it, as I outlined in <a href="./reading.html#sec-proliferating-active-matter">2024/11/15 - Proliferating Active Matter</a>, but honestly, I should have thought it through more carefully (even though, at the time, I believed I was being very thorough).</p>
<p>So, what am I really interested in? It would be the foundations of modern physics—fairly mathematical work, possibly with computational approaches. However, I’m also deeply interested in neuroscience. I thought I would find a connection by pursuing active matter projects, as studying the brain is a subset of biology. Now, I’m not so sure…</p>

<p>The reason Einstein’s theory is beautiful is because it’s the ULTIMATE PATTERN!</p>
<p>Space and time are interlinked!<br> Energy and mass are the same!<br> Mass is equal to frequency!<sup>1</sup><br> The beauty of mathematics was that ‘equality’ sign!</p>
<p>Just a very simple relationship revealed by mathematics!<br>
That was the whole purpose of physics!<br>
No matter what complicated language we use to describe concepts,<br>
There comes the language of physics: “They are the same!”</p>
<p>I cannot stop laughing.</p>
<p>“Stop arguing! They are the same!”</p>
<p>The reason the renormalisation group naively appeared as beautiful was because, as we went to higher levels of description, we somehow discovered: ‘Oh! They are the same!’</p>
<p>Now it all makes sense.</p>
<p>The reason the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem was beautiful was because it linked modular forms to elliptic curves! They are the same!<br>
The reason Euler’s relation is beautiful is because it links <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>!<br>
The reason criticality is beautiful is because the Ising model and liquid-gas model, ‘only’ at the critical point, are the same! Hence the name ‘Universality’!<br>
The reason Maxwell’s equations are beautiful is because they show that electric fields and magnetic fields are the same! The whole phenomenon you’ve been looking at, which you thought was different, is just the same!<br>
The reason nature is beautiful is because it is the same thing! Not different things! The breath of perceiving their sameness!</p>
<p>The driving motivation for me in my MSci was to say: ‘Hey! The market and the brain are THE SAME!’</p>
<p>I’ve been just chasing this beauty for my entire lifetime!</p>
<sup>1</sup> By combining <span class="math inline">\(E = mc^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E = hf\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[

<p>To get this sense of beauty, the things that are left and right of the equality sign have to be the systems that I’m truly interested in. The reason that the investigation of drying or wetting in non-equilibrium contexts using a very specific model (active Brownian particles) is not beautiful is because none of the systems that I’m considering (which is biology) are my interests!</p>

<p>After having a project meeting discussing these points: <a href="./meetings.html#sec-week10-project-meeting">2024/11/18 Weekly Project Meeting</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Sohyun,</p>
<p>I am writing to follow up on our conversation yesterday when you told me that you are no longer interested in pursuing your PhD project on surface phase transitions in active matter. I have to say that personally, I think that this is a pity because Francesco Turci and I are really excited by the idea of making progress on this topic which represents an unexplored frontier of non-equilibrium statistical physics (as are other people like Rob Jack and Mike Cates in Cambridge University). I would also note that I rather struggle to understand how this can be a fully informed decision when you have not yet engaged with the project in a meaningful way beyond reading a few background papers. However, if you really can muster no enthusiasm for the topic then I must accept that.</p>
<p>Active Matter is one of the main areas in which I see my research focussing for the foreseeable future. Are you ruling out just the particular project, or do you no longer wish to work in the field of Active Matter at all? If the latter, then the areas of potential overlap for projects that I am qualified and willing to supervise is limited. Furthermore, if the topic were to change significantly, we would need to seek approval from the Faculty who awarded you UoB funding to do a PhD and who may insist that to retain the funding you don’t stray far from the topic for which your funding was agreed as constituting a strategic priority for the school.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and with this caveat, there may be some options to consider. I have made a tentative list (see <a href="documents/241119 Redirection of PhD project.pdf">attached pdf</a>), which naturally reflects my interest and background in simulation of phase transitions and critical phenomena in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics and soft matter. Please look at the list of topics in the middle column of the document. I am happy to discuss what each project might entail at our meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>I am also happy for you to suggest a PhD project topic. But if you do this, I think that you need to go away and read about the topic in detail and prepare a written proposal that is both convincing in terms of potential for original research (as defined in the UoB PhD regulations) and likely to overlap with my research interests and expertise. Again, the topic would need to be acceptable to your funders in the faculty. To avoid wasting any time, I’ve also prepared a non-exhaustive list (third column) of projects that I happen to know from our conversations that you are interested in, but which I do not feel sufficiently well qualified or motivated to supervise.</p>
<p>I think that in this situation it would be useful for you to seek some independent advice on possible next steps. Dr Ian Lindsay is the PGR director for the School of Physics and has indicated to me that he would be happy to meet with you to discuss the situation and explain any formal processes that apply. I would strongly suggest that you take him up on this offer and write to him to arrange a meeting. His email is i.d.lindsay@bristol.ac.uk</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hi Nigel,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your email. I completely agree that it was not a fully informed decision, as I have not yet engaged much with the simulation side of things. That is something I have been trying to address since yesterday. When I went back home, I came across the paper ‘Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation Belongs to the Ising Universality Class’, which seemed so interesting that I thought it might be worthwhile to attempt simulations of active Brownian particles at the critical MIPS in 2D. Although computational resources would be demanding, it would be very interesting to perform renormalisation to rescale the system and demonstrate its scale-invariant features like the critical Ising model.</p>
<p>I remain very interested in active matter because it represents a compelling and novel paradigm in physics that resonates with my ideas deeply. I am also not ruling out our current project. I shared my personal concerns in the hope of gaining further inspiration for the current project, and I apologise if I inadvertently gave the impression that I have no interest in either this project or the overarching theme I have chosen.</p>
<p>I will not be in Bristol next Monday or Tuesday, so should we reschedule the meeting to later this week or next Wednesday? Thank you also for the separate document. I will read through the topics, as I am still quite naïve with many of the fields mentioned.</p>
<p>Thank you for introducing Ian, but at this stage, I would like to refine my thoughts further by exploring your suggestions first. It seems that I was too hasty in yesterday’s meeting, and, in hindsight, I probably should not have brought up my concerns in the way that I did.</p>
<p>Thank you, as always, for your support.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="email-sent-to-nigel-and-francesco">2024/11/28 Email sent to Nigel and Francesco</h2>
<p>Dear Nigel and Francesco,</p>
<p>I feel that it’s quite unfortunate that our project meeting ended abruptly today. After having a conversation with Ian, it became quite clear to me that there were misunderstandings in our previous meeting last week, so I hoped to clarify those today as I realised that was an important step.</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate that you set two agendas to talk about today, and both of them were really helpful! Also, you allowed me to mention what I hoped to talk about after we went through those agendas. However, I felt that when I started to bring up a conversation for clarifying my points, it appeared that both of you wanted me to leave before resolving the misunderstandings. I tried to address those concerns, but it just didn’t work, and I started to wonder if my way of communicating was not correct.</p>
<p>In our previous meeting, the reason I mentioned the vape products was because I wanted to talk about how wetting and spreading (or drying) could be interesting to me in terms of my own experiences (even though it was not an active fluid), but you misunderstood me as hoping to make a new vape product (which you wrote in the document that you can’t supervise). The whole point of the previous meeting last week was for me to consult with you on why our initial project was interesting from your perspectives. You mentioned that you started to investigate drying at first but didn’t see any drying. Also, the point I raised to Ian and you was that we don’t observe a drying transition in active fluids in real life, so I hoped to understand your motivation for pursuing it.</p>
<p>I chose my PhD in active matter because I was largely inspired by two philosophical papers: <br> 1. Keller, Evelyn Fox. 2016. “Active Matter, Then and Now.” <em>History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences</em> 38: 1–11. <br> 2. McGivern, Patrick. 2020. “Active Materials: Minimal Models of Cognition?” <em>Adaptive Behavior</em> 28 (6): 441–51.</p>
<p>This new field, which has gained significant popularity over the past 20 years, struck me as a paradigm shift. The advertised project was quite general, and in January, you mentioned that it could evolve based on my interests. However, once I started my PhD, I was given an initial project that, if I were to summarise concisely (for Ian), involves investigating how active Brownian particles (ABPs), which evolve through overdamped Langevin equations, interact with surfaces to induce drying surface phase transitions via molecular dynamics simulations. What was very interesting about this model was that, without any attractive interactions, the particles form large-scale structures, described as motility-induced phase separation, simply by turning on activity (motility). Also, it appeared that this model maps to artificial colloids (e.g., Janus particles) or motile bacteria.</p>
<p>The problem arose from the fact that I’ve never observed a drying transition in these systems in empirical reality, which kept bringing me back to the map-territory relation. I was also uncertain whether the results I might obtain could be generalisable to a broader class of active matter systems. As I was reading <em>Physics and Beyond</em> by Werner Heisenberg, I came across Einstein’s remark: “It is the theory which decides what we can observe,” made after he considered Mach’s perspective to be naïve. However, it seemed to me that, as I was reading through papers and articles, many statistical physicists simply play with models without carefully examining their assumptions or their relation to empirical evidence. I tried raising this concern last week so that I could gain a different perspective from you, but if it was to be largely dismissed as being “too philosophical” to pursue further discussion, then that’s fine, but it’s just unfortunate.</p>
<p>So, in summary, I raised my concern to gain more insights from you, while you understood it as me having completely lost interest in the project, which I found out with Ian was a miscommunication.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of progress, yes, I did engage with other materials outside our project (these are for fun and not to be confused with what I do during my working hours). But I have always spent a lot of time reading articles and papers related to our project, as well as understanding the code. In the beginning, you clearly pointed out that, as a PhD student, at first, it’s important to understand the wider context, and it’s a mistake for them to just start working on the problems without this background reading. I’ve been doing so, and you said in the first email (which you sent on the 13th) that you were not worried about my progress. Then, in your second email after our project meeting, I was told that I’m not making meaningful progress.</p>
<p>I’m quite confused about all this. It takes a long time to read papers from a new field because, during my undergraduate studies, we didn’t cover non-equilibrium statistical physics or colloidal physics. For example, Francesco asked me if I had learned about random walks, but we also didn’t cover this basic concept either! Also, it takes a long time to understand the code written in C++. Yes, there are similarities as I did C and Java in the past, but even a single file such as <em>fix_abp.cpp</em> has a lot of links to other codes such as <em>fix_abp.h, force.h, random_mars.h,</em> etc.</p>
<p>As you pointed out in terms of supervision, yes, I won’t raise any philosophical concerns or my interests outside the set project at all. Because if I try to do so, it seems I create misunderstandings. However, I did want to emphasise that my mind is now clear, and maybe I could bring what I wrote on the 25th, which summarises how my motivation and ambition have settled:</p>
<hr>
<p>When I got home, I had a phone call with my mum and shared how much the situation had changed. Reflecting on what I said to her:</p>
<p>While I was at the train station for hours, I found myself thinking deeply about my project, the papers I read last week, and my conversations with Nigel and Ian. I realised that my project presents a perfect opportunity to learn about useful concepts for describing non-equilibrium systems, such as entropy production, the Fokker–Planck equation, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Now, investigating these concepts using the simplest models from the particle perspective of active matter feels really exciting! If a drying transition is observed, it will also be a great chance to master the theoretical understanding and application of renormalisation group techniques.</p>
<p>Reading various papers helped me appreciate how interesting colloids and bacteria can be. Bacteria represent the simplest form of living systems, and through motility-induced phase separation, these systems form large-scale structures without any attractive interactions. Thinking about surface phase transitions became particularly intriguing when I considered how 3D structures form 2D boundaries. Boundaries are key to how we differentiate objects. Even in comics, we draw the boundaries of characters and objects. This perspective made the topic even more interesting.</p>
<p>I also admire how my supervisors approached the problem, using an order parameter to measure the asymmetry within the capillary system. This method effectively avoids the complexities of defining surface tensions and focuses instead on the geometrical aspects of the problem. Once these ideas crystallised in my mind, I felt certain that I wanted to become an expert in this field. If someone asks about surface phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems, I want to be the person they turn to for advice.</p>
<p>These thoughts were swirling in my mind, and strangely, the weather even stopped me from travelling to London to attend the Statistical Physics of Cognition conference, where I had planned to network with people in that field. I don’t believe in mystical things, but the timing was mysterious. This kind of weather disruption, preventing travel between cities, hasn’t happened to me in my five years living in the UK.</p>
<p>I was also thinking about Nigel and Francesco and how thoughtful they both are. I want to become a light that brightens the path for us.</p>
<hr>
<p>But, as you pointed out, I will separate our project notes from my logbook on my project website. Also, thank you very much for introducing the critical Casimir effect in active fluids analogues. I’ll read through the materials on my own over this week. (Initially, as my mind has settled, I was going to work on the simulation side as I wasn’t certain how to construct a wall as you did in your papers with my given code, but I will delay that work until next week.)</p>
<p>Somehow, your email which followed from our meeting just now has arrived while I was writing this email. I’ll read through your email after I send this.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sohyun</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="email-received-from-nigel-2">2024/11/28 Email received from Nigel</h2>
<p>Dear Sohyun (cc Francesco, Ian),</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up on our meeting today and reiterate and elaborate in writing some of the points covered.</p>
<p>As you had previously expressed reservations about continuing with the Active Drying project, we discussed an alternative project in Active Matter centred around the Critical Casimir Effect. You said that on reflection you are happy to continue with the original project, and we agreed that we could keep the Critical Casimir Effect project as a backup or as a topic for future work.</p>
<p>On more general matters, we stated that from the point of view of the student-supervisor relationship, there needs to be a clear separation between your work on the project and outside interests. The responsibilities of PhD supervisors do not extend beyond supporting your work on the project and advising/supporting should there be any issues (eg illness/personal situation) that are affecting your ability to progress with the project. Project meetings are therefore not for discussing anything with you except the science of the project or pastoral issues that may be affecting your ability to work.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you want to use a blog as a lab book to record progress and notes on papers read etc, this is laudable and desirable for facilitating discussions, but what you have been writing and sharing with us has turned into a sort of personal diary and that’s inappropriate for the student-supervisor relationship. If you want us to read things then they need to be confined to matters directly related to the project.</p>
<p>Being a successful PhD student requires a certain level of commitment. While it is early days and we don’t have serious concerns about your progress, we do note that you seem to be spending considerable time writing blogs and thinking about philosophy, vaping, neuroscience, and reading and rereading books, and lecture notes, etc., the relevance of which is not clear. While you can of course do what you want in your own time, we feel that you need to take care not to blur the boundaries between what is in scope for the project work and what is not. From your blog and recent conversations, we are concerned that this might be happening.</p>
<p>I hope that these comments are helpful. They are not intended to be critical – we just want you to have clear and realistic expectations of the process so that you have a satisfied, enjoyable, and successful PhD journey.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Nigel and Francesco</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="email-sent-to-nigel-and-francesco-1">2024/11/29 Email sent to Nigel and Francesco</h2>
<p>Dear Nigel,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. I’ve been reading about the critical Casimir effect, and it’s so interesting! There was research using the run-and-tumble model by Ray et al.&nbsp;in 2014, and since run-and-tumble and ABPs can be mapped onto each other, I thought this paper was quite relevant, so I uploaded it to Zotero (under the category of Active Casimir Effect). Also, there was a concise review on this theme by Bechinger et al.&nbsp;in 2016. Even recently, there has been work on this topic using flocking active matter by Fava et al.&nbsp;in 2024. It’s so interesting, and I deeply appreciate you coming up with this suggestion! By Monday next week, I’ll read more and finalise my choice, though at this stage, I feel it would be more worthwhile to continue with the active drying project first to apply the concepts I’ve learned over the past two months in simulations. If that’s the decision, I can see myself working on the active Casimir effect right after the initial project.</p>
<p>Yes, I won’t share anything unrelated to the project anymore. If I may offer an excuse, there were two occasions I shared something: one was a dialogue related to active matter on 17th of September, and the other was a note on ‘things to discuss’ for the project meeting when I was concerned about the project two weeks ago. I thought both were related, but I apologise and appreciate your pointing out that they were not the right forms to share. I won’t do it again.</p>
<p>I have honestly felt quite isolated at times this semester as the only PhD student in theoretical physics investigating active matter. So, it was such an enjoyable opportunity for me to have a conversation with you and Francesco, even in broader contexts beyond our project. However, I’ll make sure to confine my conversations strictly to the current project.</p>
<p>Your comments have been helpful, and I’ll be more realistic from now on. I have also closed the website, as I probably enjoyed designing it a bit too much. While it was intended to document everything I do during my PhD in a self-contained way, it may not have conveyed how much time I dedicate to our project.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Sohyun</p>
