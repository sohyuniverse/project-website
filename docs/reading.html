<p>By James Ladyman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Karoline Wiesner</p>
<p>My final-year MSci project involved the study of a complex system, foreign exchange markets. Each individual currency was treated as a spin in the Ising model, and by applying E.T. Jaynes’s principle of maximum entropy, we discovered the structure of interactions between these entities. Remarkably, this simple model of magnetism can also describe the phase transitions of liquid-gas systems, as they fall into the same universality class. This model has even been extended to study how critical our brain is, giving rise to the field of the critical brain hypothesis. Therefore, many ideas during my research project were derived from neuroscience papers. The financial market and the brain: both are complex systems.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I read a paper published by James Ladyman, a professor of philosophy of science at Bristol, titled ‘What is a Complex System?’ <span class="citation" data-cites="ladyman2013complex">(<a href="#ref-ladyman2013complex" role="doc-biblioref">Ladyman, Lambert, and Wiesner 2013</a>)</span>. As I started my PhD at Bristol, my second supervisor, Francesco, mentioned that he also published a book about complexity. It became clear to me that I should read this book.</p>

Ladyman, James, James Lambert, and Karoline Wiesner. 2013. <span>“What Is a Complex System?”</span> <em>European Journal for Philosophy of Science</em> 3: 33–67.
</div></div><p>Chapter 1 presents The Truisms of Complexity Science as follows:</p>
<p><em>1. More is different.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Nonliving systems can generate order.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Complexity can come from simplicity.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Coordinated behaviour does not require an overall controller.</em></p>
<p><em>5. Complex systems are often modelled as networks or information processing systems.</em></p>
<p><em>6. There are various kinds of invariance and forms of universal behaviour in complex systems.</em></p>
<p><em>7. Complexity science is computational and probabilistic.</em></p>
<p><em>8. Complexity science involves multiple disciplines.</em></p>
<p><em>9. There is a difference between the order that complex systems produce and the order of the complex systems themselves.</em></p>
<p>Features that are necessary and sufficient for which kinds of complexity and complex system are as follows:</p>
<p><em>1. Numerosity: complex systems involve many interactions among many components.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Disorder and diversity: the interactions in a complex system are not coordinated or controlled centrally, and the components may differ.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Feedback: the interactions in complex systems are iterated so that there is feedback from previous interactions on a time scale relevant to the system’s emergent dynamics.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Non-equilibrium: complex systems are open to the environment and are often driven by something external.</em></p>
<p><em>5. Spontaneous order and self-organisation: complex systems exhibit structure and order that arises out of the interactions among their parts.</em></p>
<p><em>6. Nonlinearity: complex systems exhibit nonlinear dependence on parameters or external drivers.</em></p>
<p><em>7. Robustness: the structure and function of complex systems is stable under relevant perturbations.</em></p>
<p><em>8. Nested structure and modularity: there may be multiple scales of structure, clustering and specialisation of function in complex systems.</em></p>
<p><em>9. History and memory: complex systems often require a very long history to exist and often store information about history.</em></p>
<p><em>10. Adaptive behaviour: complex systems are often able to modify their behaviour depending on the state of the environment and the predictions they make about it.</em></p>

<p>2024/9/27</p>
<p>Reading <em>What is a Complex System?</em> by James Ladyman and Karoline Wiesner. The purpose of reading is to understand how systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium (a feature of complex systems) relate to a wide range of concepts associated with complexity.</p>
<p>• There was a video that helped clarify what is meant by a Markov chain and a stochastic process being stationary: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3AkTO9HLXo&amp;list=PLM8wYQRetTxBkdvBtz-gw8b9lcVkdXQKV">Markov Chains Clearly Explained! Part - 1</a>. His other videos are helpful as well. For example, when I saw <span class="math inline">\(P_{ij}^{(n)} = A_{ij}^n\)</span> from the <em>n-Step Transition Matrix</em> video (Part 3), it was quite surprising. However, the Part 5 video on hidden Markov models wasn’t very helpful, but reading the appendix in the book was sufficient.</p>
<p>• What I’ve felt from reading this book (currently at p.90) is that it presents a lot of different ideas and has interesting discussions on the history of science, but I only seem to get excited when it starts mentioning the brain. I’m not sure if I’m necessarily interested in quantifying complexity. From the Apple notes on 28/9/2024:</p>
<p><em>As I’m reading through </em>What is a Complex System?<em>, it seems that the description of a complex system arises as we have more representations at different scales of analysis. The concept of ‘complexity’ was destined to arise as the scientific era evolved.<br>
Non-equilibrium systems arise because we define what systems are in thermodynamic equilibrium, which are idealisations.<br>
Things that fail to be idealised fall into this dualistic concept: non-equilibrium.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>2024/10/3</p>
<p>It took about two weeks to finish this book. It was an accessible read until I reached chapter 4, which was <em>Measuring Features of Complex Systems</em>. In the end, I’m glad that I read it, even though I somehow felt rushed to finish as there were other responsibilities to manage continuously, such as setting up clusters for my university Mac, teaching, office setup, etc. Most importantly, from now on, I am going to focus on reading material that is directly related to my project since it may give the impression to my supervisors that I’m not working hard. Reading a book like this takes a long time, as there are many new terms I had not encountered before.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a good read. Would I buy a physical copy for myself? Maybe not, but it was a good one.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure why the surface tension is defined in that way, as it’s normally considered force per unit area. So, I asked ChatGPT:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click to reveal the answer!
</summary>
<p>The definition of surface tension in this context is derived from the thermodynamic perspective, which connects surface tension to the grand potential difference between a bulk fluid and a system with an interface. The reasoning follows these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Grand Potential Definition</strong>: The grand potential, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, is given by: <span class="math display">\[
\Omega = U - TS - \mu N
\]</span> This expression is crucial for systems where particle number and volume are allowed to fluctuate, such as liquid-vapour interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surface Tension from Thermodynamics</strong>: Surface tension, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, represents the energy cost per unit area to create an interface. In thermodynamic terms, this corresponds to how much the grand potential increases when introducing an interface between coexisting phases (liquid and vapour).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Difference between Bulk and Interface</strong>: The bulk grand potential, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_b\)</span>, corresponds to a system without an interface (uniform bulk). When an interface is introduced, the grand potential changes, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\text{ex}}\)</span>, the excess grand potential: <span class="math display">\[
\Omega_{\text{ex}} = \Omega - \Omega_b
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surface Tension as Excess Grand Potential per Unit Area</strong>: The surface tension is then defined as the excess grand potential per unit area, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, required to form the interface: <span class="math display">\[
\gamma = \frac{\Omega_{\text{ex}}}{A} = \frac{\Omega - \Omega_b}{A}
\]</span> This formulation makes sense because surface tension describes the energetic cost to create a unit area of interface between two phases.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, while surface tension is often discussed in terms of force per unit length in simpler mechanical contexts, in thermodynamics, it is expressed as the excess grand potential per unit area. This ties into how interfaces modify the system’s energy in comparison to the bulk. The two definitions are equivalent but applied in different contexts: mechanical (force/length) vs.&nbsp;thermodynamic (energy/area).</p>

<p>Now for equation (2.1.6):</p>

\]</span></p>
<p>Now, using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \frac{dA}{A}\)</span> is small for constant area, we can ignore this term, giving:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s_{\text{ex}} dT + \frac{\Gamma}{A} d\mu + d\gamma = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>This is equation (2.1.9).</p>

<p>At constant temperature (<span class="math inline">\(dT = 0\)</span>), this simplifies to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Gamma}{A} d\mu = -d\gamma
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(d\mu\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Gamma}{A} = -\left(\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial \mu}\right)_T
\]</span></p>
<p>This is equation (2.1.10).</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure what the one-particle density is or its use, so I asked ChatGPT:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click to reveal the answer!
</summary>
<p>The one-particle density function, often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})\)</span>, represents the probability density of finding a particle at a specific position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}\)</span> in a system of particles. It describes how particles are distributed in space on average and is a key observable in statistical mechanics and the study of fluids.</p>
<p>The equation given is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{\rho}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]</span></p>
<p>This is the <strong>one-particle density operator</strong>, and it has the following meaning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Dirac Delta Function</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_j)\)</span> is a Dirac delta function that ‘picks out’ the position of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th particle. It is equal to zero everywhere except at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_j\)</span>, where it is infinite, ensuring that it integrates to 1. Thus, it counts the presence of a particle at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_j\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summation over All Particles</strong>: The sum runs over all particles <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, so this operator adds up the contributions from all particles in the system, effectively counting the number of particles at position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the one-particle density operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\rho}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})\)</span> gives the total number of particles at position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}\)</span> in the system. Since it is an operator, the actual <strong>one-particle density</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\langle \hat{\rho}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r}) \rangle\)</span>, as defined in equation (2.3.2), is obtained by averaging over all possible configurations of the system in the given ensemble (such as the grand canonical ensemble).</p>
<p><em>Why Does It Look Like This?</em></p>
<p>The form of equation (2.3.1) stems from how we represent the microscopic distribution of particles in space. The Dirac delta function ensures that for each particle, its position contributes to the overall density only at the exact location where that particle exists. This is a standard way to construct density operators in statistical mechanics because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The delta function precisely pinpoints the position of a particle.</li>
<li>Summing over all particles ensures that the density operator accounts for the total number of particles present in the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This representation allows us to describe spatially inhomogeneous systems where the density may vary across different regions (e.g., near a surface or an external potential). For homogeneous fluids, where particles are evenly distributed, this density would reduce to a constant value (the bulk density <span class="math inline">\(\rho_b\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p>The one-particle density operator, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\rho}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})\)</span>, reflects how particles are distributed in space at a microscopic level. The delta functions track the positions of individual particles, and summing over all particles gives the total density at position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}\)</span>. The actual one-particle density function <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})\)</span> is then the ensemble average of this operator over all configurations of the system.</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure why each variable is specifically chosen to form those equations. For example, in section 2.4.3, I do not understand why λ can be factored out of g on the right-hand side when λ has two different exponents, a and b. So, I asked ChatGPT:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click to reveal the answer!
</summary>
<p>Starting with Equation (2.4.3):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g(\lambda^a u, \lambda^b v) = \lambda g(u, v)
\]</span></p>
<p>This equation states that the function <span class="math inline">\(g(u, v)\)</span> is a <strong>generalised homogeneous function</strong>. To understand why it takes this form and why <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> appears outside the function on the right-hand side, let’s break this down:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Homogeneous Functions</strong>: A function is called homogeneous of degree <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> if, when all its arguments are scaled by a factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the function itself scales by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^\alpha\)</span>. Mathematically, for a homogeneous function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span>, we would have: <span class="math display">\[
f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^\alpha f(x, y)
\]</span> This property is common in critical phenomena where we are dealing with power-law behaviour near critical points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generalised Homogeneous Functions</strong>: The function <span class="math inline">\(g(u, v)\)</span> is a <strong>generalised</strong> homogeneous function because it allows different exponents for different variables. In this case, the variables <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> scale with different exponents <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> under the same scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a u\)</span>: Here, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> behaves differently under scaling compared to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b v\)</span>: Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Why <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be factored out</strong>: The key to understanding why <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be factored out on the right-hand side despite having different exponents for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> lies in the definition of a generalised homogeneous function. By construction, we impose that when the variables are scaled in a particular way (with exponents <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>), the function scales by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> itself. This is a property we assign to <span class="math inline">\(g(u, v)\)</span>. It doesn’t mean that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is constant; rather, the entire function <span class="math inline">\(g(u, v)\)</span> is designed to respond to the scaling in this specific manner.</p>
<p>The exponents <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> control how <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> individually respond to scaling, but the overall response of the function is to scale as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. The scaling of the function on the right-hand side doesn’t contradict the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> has different exponents inside the arguments. This is simply a mathematical constraint on how the function <span class="math inline">\(g(u, v)\)</span> behaves under scaling.</p>
<p>In other words, the form: <span class="math display">\[
g(\lambda^a u, \lambda^b v)
\]</span> ensures that the function scales uniformly by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, despite the individual variables scaling differently.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Equation (2.4.4):</p>
<p>Now, let’s explain how this scaling idea applies to the singular part of the free energy in equation (2.4.4):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\omega_{\text{sing}}(\delta \mu, t) = \lambda^{-d} \omega_{\text{sing}}(\lambda^a \delta \mu, \lambda^b t)
\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Variables</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu = \mu - \mu_{\text{co}}\)</span> is the difference between the chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the critical chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\text{co}}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the reduced temperature: <span class="math inline">\(t = \frac{T - T_c}{T_c}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the dimensionality of the system (important for scaling relations).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Applying the Scaling Relation</strong>: Here, the function <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{\text{sing}}\)</span>, which represents the singular part of the free energy, is assumed to be a generalised homogeneous function. This means it should follow a scaling law similar to the one introduced in equation (2.4.3).</p>
<p>The variables <span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b\)</span>, respectively, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are scaling exponents that determine how <span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> change when scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{-d}\)</span>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{-d}\)</span> appears because we are dealing with free energy, which is an extensive quantity. In thermodynamics, extensive quantities scale with the volume of the system, and in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional space, the volume scales as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^d\)</span>. Since we are dealing with the <strong>singular</strong> part of the free energy, the scaling reflects the dimensionality of the system. The minus sign arises because, under scaling, the free energy decreases as the system grows larger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Free Choice of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span></strong>: The scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is arbitrary, meaning you can choose its value to simplify the equation. In this case, we choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b = t^{-1}\)</span>, which simplifies the second argument (the temperature dependence) of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{\text{sing}}\)</span>. By doing this, we reduce the complexity of the equation and make the temperature scaling explicit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Equation (2.4.5):</p>
<p>This equation shows the final form after choosing <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b = t^{-1}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\omega_{\text{sing}}(\delta \mu, t) = t^{d/b} \omega_{\text{sing}}(t^{-a/b} \delta \mu, 1)
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why this form?</strong> By setting <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b = t^{-1}\)</span>, we have scaled out the temperature dependence in the second argument of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{\text{sing}}\)</span>. This isolates the temperature dependence into the prefactor <span class="math inline">\(t^{d/b}\)</span>, while leaving a scaling function that depends only on the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu / t^{a/b}\)</span>, which is now the only scaling variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(t^{d/b}\)</span>: This represents how the singular part of the free energy depends on temperature near the critical point. The exponent <span class="math inline">\(d/b\)</span> dictates how strongly the free energy diverges as <span class="math inline">\(t \to 0\)</span> (the critical point).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\left( \frac{\delta \mu}{t^{a/b}} \right)\)</span>: The function <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is the scaling function, which encodes the remaining dependence on the scaled chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu / t^{a/b}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In Summary: - In equation (2.4.3), the exponents <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> control how the variables <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> scale. Despite their different scaling behaviours, the overall function scales by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> because it is designed as a generalised homogeneous function. - In equation (2.4.4), the singular part of the free energy near the critical point follows a similar scaling law, with the dimensionality <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> appearing as a factor to reflect the extensive nature of free energy. - In equation (2.4.5), we choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b = t^{-1}\)</span> to simplify the scaling form, making the dependence on temperature explicit and reducing the complexity of the equation. The resulting expression separates the prefactor <span class="math inline">\(t^{d/b}\)</span> and leaves a scaling function that depends only on the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\delta \mu / t^{a/b}\)</span>, which captures the critical behaviour.</p>

Fluctuations? <em>One correlated entity</em>?
</summary>
<p>In the context of phase transitions, particularly near a <strong>critical point</strong>, the term “fluctuations” refers to <strong>fluctuations in the local density</strong> of the system. Let’s explain in detail what this means, especially in the context of <strong>critical opalescence</strong> and <strong>long-range correlations</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Density Fluctuations</strong>: When we talk about “density” in this context, we mean the <strong>number density</strong> of particles in a given volume. In simple terms, it’s how densely packed the particles are in a particular region. The density can fluctuate due to thermal motion, and these fluctuations are typically small and localised in non-critical conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, as a system approaches the critical point of a phase transition (e.g., a liquid-vapour transition), the magnitude of these fluctuations grows dramatically.</p>
<section id="what-happens-near-the-critical-point" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-happens-near-the-critical-point">What happens near the critical point?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Correlation Length (<span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>)</strong>: The correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> represents the distance over which particles in the system are correlated or “communicate” with each other. Normally, this length is finite, and beyond this distance, the properties of the system in one region do not affect another region.</p>
<p>Near the critical point, however, <span class="math inline">\(\xi \to \infty\)</span>. This means that particles separated by very large distances (even macroscopic scales) are correlated with each other. The entire system essentially becomes <strong>one correlated entity</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diverging Fluctuations</strong>: As the correlation length grows, the fluctuations in the local density (i.e., how many particles are in a given region at any time) also grow larger. This happens because, when the correlation length is large, particles across large distances influence each other. As a result, fluctuations occur over all length scales, from small to very large.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Density Fluctuations</strong>: Specifically, these are <strong>fluctuations in the number of particles</strong> in a given volume. Imagine regions in a fluid where the particle density becomes temporarily higher or lower than the average. At the critical point, these fluctuations become very large and occur over very large distances, leading to the system appearing “cloudy” or “milky” — this is the phenomenon of <strong>critical opalescence</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>What exactly is fluctuating?</strong> At the critical point, <strong>density</strong> is the key fluctuating quantity, but more generally, the term “fluctuations” can refer to:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Order Parameter Fluctuations</strong>: Near a critical point, there is typically an <strong>order parameter</strong> that characterises the phase transition. For example, in the liquid-vapour transition, this order parameter could be the <strong>difference in density</strong> between the liquid and vapour phases. As the system approaches the critical point, the fluctuations in the order parameter become large.</p>
<p>For example, in a fluid near the liquid-vapour critical point:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the liquid phase, particles are densely packed.</li>
<li>In the vapour phase, particles are more spread out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Near the critical point, there is no sharp distinction between liquid and vapour phases. Instead, the system fluctuates between states that resemble both phases. You might see a region that has the density of a liquid next to a region that has the density of a vapour, and these regions appear and disappear rapidly.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Why do these fluctuations occur?</strong> At the critical point, the system is in a delicate balance between two phases (e.g., liquid and vapour). The free energy landscape becomes very flat near the critical point, meaning that the system can fluctuate easily between different configurations with very little energy cost. These fluctuations span all length scales, leading to the phenomenon where large regions of the system can fluctuate in density.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Opalescence</strong>: The critical opalescence mentioned in the text is a direct consequence of these large fluctuations in density. Light passing through the fluid is scattered by the density fluctuations. Since the fluctuations occur over a wide range of length scales (from very small to very large), they scatter light across all wavelengths, leading to the “milky” appearance of the fluid near the critical point.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why does light scatter?</strong> Light is scattered by regions of varying density because the refractive index of the fluid depends on its density. When the density fluctuates significantly over large distances, light passing through the fluid encounters regions of different densities, leading to scattering in all directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is fluctuating near the critical point?</strong>: Primarily, the <strong>number density</strong> (i.e., the number of particles per unit volume) fluctuates near the critical point.</li>
<li><strong>Why do these fluctuations grow?</strong>: As the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> becomes large, regions of the system separated by large distances become correlated, allowing large-scale fluctuations in density.</li>
<li><strong>What’s the physical manifestation?</strong>: These fluctuations lead to observable phenomena such as <strong>critical opalescence</strong>, where light is scattered by the large fluctuations in density, causing the fluid to appear milky or cloudy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the “fluctuations” near the critical point refer to <strong>density fluctuations</strong>, which are tied to the divergence of the correlation length, and these fluctuations grow larger and affect larger regions of the system as the critical point is approached.</p>

<p>By Albert Einstein</p>
<p>Since I am studying a model called active Brownian particles, a thought occurred to me: I should actually read where this understanding of Brownian motion came from! This was done by the very man: Albert Einstein in 1905 <span class="citation" data-cites="einstein1905motion">(<a href="#ref-einstein1905motion" role="doc-biblioref">Einstein et al. 1905</a>)</span>. I normally leave my iPad in my office so whenever I needed derivations, I used a pen and note, quite a classical way while reading a classical paper:</p>

<p>I’m so glad that I read this. It reminded me of how much I loved studying thermodynamics during my undergraduate studies. It was kind of like studying geometry (or topology). I consider a system subject to constraints and investigate how the particle behaves given the state variables. The paper wasn’t straightforward to read, as I had to remind myself of several concepts such as the continuous form of entropy, perturbation theory, and Fourier transforms to find a solution for diffusion equations.</p>
<p>I really liked the way he displayed his logic. He considers a system: a pure solvent and suspended particles. These particles are confined by a semi-permeable wall, which only allows solvent to flow, not the solute. Then he thinks about the existing concept of osmotic pressure, which inhibits the solvent from moving to equalise concentrations. He then makes several <em>reasonable</em> assumptions, such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Suspended particles have slow and irregular motions due to the solvent’s molecules.</li>
<li>The motions of those individual particles are independent of each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>He then links the diffusion coefficient to two different contexts. The first is through the theory of diffusion, involving concepts of entropy and free energy. The second is through the theory of thermal molecular motion, where he considers the rate of change of density. By uniting these two theories, he arrives at the root-mean-square displacement of the suspended particle. Wow!</p>
<p>I’m so happy to have chosen a theoretical physics PhD. Thinking about how theories interconnect reveals a universal understanding. I’m looking forward to reading more of his articles.</p>

<p>Before starting our project, I was a little concerned about whether computational simulation is a valid way to understand the fundamental order of nature. I thought that what we do as physicists is observe systems through experiments, theorise with idealised objects to gain predictive power, and then test the theory by observing again. This thought process was probably inspired by a Kantian perspective; I read his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> in high school, where he posits that causality is a presupposition of reasoning. For those purposes, idealised objects had to be mathematical (forms or images from Plato) and needed to represent what I directly observe in empirical reality.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure why the extremum condition applies specifically to variations in <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>. So, I asked ChatGPT:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click to reveal the answer!
</summary>
<p>You’re right to question this subtle point.</p>
<p>The key insight lies in understanding that when we talk about maximising the total entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{tot}} = S_1 + S_2\)</span> of a closed system with fixed total values of energy, volume, and particle number, the only degrees of freedom available for changes are the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> between the subsystems.</p>
<p>Here’s the reasoning in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fixed Total Quantities Impose Constraints</strong>: Because the total energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{tot}} = E_1 + E_2\)</span>, volume <span class="math inline">\(V_{\text{tot}} = V_1 + V_2\)</span>, and particle number <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{tot}} = N_1 + N_2\)</span> are fixed, any changes in <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> must be offset by corresponding changes in <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> to keep these sums constant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entropy Extremum Condition</strong>: In equilibrium thermodynamics, the Second Law requires that the total entropy of an isolated (or closed) system reaches a maximum (or an extremum) at equilibrium. However, since the system is closed and these total quantities are fixed, the system cannot simply increase or decrease its overall <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{tot}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_{\text{tot}}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{tot}}\)</span>. Instead, any adjustments to entropy must occur through <em>redistributions</em> of these quantities between subsystems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Redistribution as the Only Available Variation</strong>: Thus, the extremisation of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{tot}}\)</span> must occur specifically with respect to the variables that can change within the subsystems while satisfying the overall conservation constraints. Since <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{tot}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_{\text{tot}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{tot}}\)</span> are fixed, the only available independent variations in <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{tot}}\)</span> come from redistributing <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> (and equivalently <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Derivative Vanishing Condition</strong>: For <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{tot}} = S_1 + S_2\)</span> to be maximised (or extremised) under these constraints, the derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{tot}}\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> must vanish. This is because any non-zero derivative would indicate that entropy could be further increased by adjusting these redistributive variables, contradicting the requirement of equilibrium.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, we require the extremum condition with respect to <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> specifically because these are the variables that can be redistributed between the subsystems within the constraint of fixed total quantities. This is why the extremum condition applies to these specific derivatives, and not to other parameters.</p>

<p>It’s the first time I’m reading this in English; the title of the book in Korean is 부분과 전체, which might translate to <em>Parts and the Whole</em>. I’ve read it many times since I was in high school, and it has been highly influential to me as a physicist throughout my life. To capture some of the things I want to revisit later:</p>

<p>So far, having read up to page 89, it has all been interesting, except for Chapter 4 (<em>Lessons in Politics and History</em>).

<p>All these realms were so enjoyable to learn, but now, as a researcher, I wonder what realms are still open. I thought one of them was non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, but it appears to me that this theory can’t be axiomatic, implying that all systems out of equilibrium must be described differently.</p>

<p>‘Forms through which matter streams,’ as Niels Bohr described, was the most profound characterisation of organisms I have encountered. I used to wonder, what about this structure remains? Does it actually persist, given that a person changes continuously as a child becomes an adult? Is it simply the name (person) we assign that represents this form of life? With this thought, is there really a distinction between animate and inanimate objects?</p>
<p>When I read <em>Timaeus</em> by Plato in high school, he described geometrical forms as the basis of earth, fire, water, and air, even though I found his idea peculiar (like everything is made of right triangles). At the time, I thought the properties that define those mathematical forms were responsible for things maintaining their structure in the way we perceive over time (since all forms change shape as time passes). My master’s research was also focused on investigating this homeostasis in an ideal structure—not physical but something we perceive—in the context of foreign exchange markets. This line of thought was also captured well by Bohr’s question: “Can quantum mechanics explain nature’s tendency to form structures through which matter with fixed chemical properties can stream for a limited time?”</p>

<p>This passage about the discovery of antimatter was one of the reasons I chose a physics degree, along with my ambition to formally study general relativity. Although I didn’t score well in my particle physics exam in third year due to a part-time job over winter break, it remains one of the most exciting units I’ve taken. Here are the scores and ratings I gave to my third and fourth-year units with scores of at least 4:</p>
<p>5: Physics Research Project (83), Quantum Physics (88)<br>
4.5: Physics of Phase Transitions (85), Analytical Mechanics (66), Particle Physics (58)<br>
4: Quantum Information Theory (68), Foundations of Modern Physics (68), Methods of Theoretical Physics (63)</p>
<p>It’s surprising that general relativity only scored 3.5, but it seems I didn’t enjoy the lecture style despite being fascinated by the content.</p>

<p>This passage captures the reason I didn’t pursue a philosophy degree, despite having written about philosophy of science. What I realised was the fluidity of language, and at some point, reading philosophy felt like participating in a language game. Even when I wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lGEIUBTY_RgLZfvyVO8nhSzJ_3SpVR0n1QEegImHv4g/edit?usp=sharing"><em>The Self and the World</em></a>, I included definitions for the terms I used in the document. In contrast, I conceived mathematical objects as eternal, grounded solidly in axioms. I couldn’t imagine any language other than this to describe the hidden secrets of the universe as eternal representations—unchanging, unmoved, and concrete.</p>

<p>Another book I feel closely connected to is the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. It’s probably not an exaggeration to say that my whole life has been devoted to understanding the meaning of Tao, even though Lao Tzu paradoxically said, “The Tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao.” One day, I realised it is synonymous with the Truth or, in more Platonic terms, the formless. Ineffable. That’s when I wrote this diary: <a href="https://sohyuniverse.wordpress.com/2024/09/17/2023-03-27-is-it-a-joke/">Is “It” a Joke?</a></p>

<p>This reveals the reason why I chose the theme of <em>active matter</em>. I was curious about how this model suddenly emerged in the last 25 years. Why is there such a sudden interest in this concept? What possibilities does it offer for understanding nature? What contributions can I make to the circle of human knowledge?</p>
<hr>
<p>While reading through the <em>Scientific and Political Disputes (1956-1957)</em> chapter, I realised I can only concentrate when scientific matters are being discussed, such as the conversations between Heisenberg and Wolfgang about the mathematical theory for elementary particles.</p>

<p>I have finally finished the book. Although the above image is not the last page, I love this book because it begins with Plato and ends with him. <em>Timaeus</em> was the book that shaped my worldview when I was in high school, and when I first encountered <em>Physics and Beyond</em>, I was thrilled to find someone in history who asked the same questions I had while reading <em>Timaeus</em>. Since then, my understanding has deepened, and I’ve come to see that all philosophy traces back to Plato. Last year, a decade later, I finally had a direct understanding of what Plato described through some interesting experiences.</p>
<p>Even beyond that passage in the screenshot, it’s truly worth rereading. People at that time were already considering how natural laws conform to different scales, touching on the concept of <em>emergence</em>, which is the field I’m now working in.</p>
<p>While reading this book, I rewatched the documentary series <em>Atom</em>, hosted by Jim Al-Khalili. I remember watching it for the first time in high school, loving it immensely, and being struck by statements from scholars like Paul Dirac, who said, “A physical law must possess mathematical beauty.” I was curious about what QED implied once I start learning about it at university, such as how all the matter we see is just reflections of virtual particles. That was a long time ago, and that naïveté and curiosity are what led me to study physics. I’d like to close with what Jim Al-Khalili said (even though I largely disagree with his interpretation of quantum mechanics in that chapter) at the end of <em>The Illusion of Reality</em> (the third episode):</p>
<p><em>In the last 100 years, we have peered deep inside the atom, the basic building block of the universe. And inside this tiny object, we have found a strange new world governed by exotic laws that at times seem to defy reason. Atoms present us with dizzying contradictions. They can behave both as particles or waves. They appear to be in more than one place at the same time. They force us to rethink what we mean by past and future, by cause and effect. And they tell us strange things about where the universe came from and where it’s going. Pretty amazing stuff for something that’s just a millionth of a millimetre across. That’s why Niels Bohr, the father of atomic physics, once said that, when it comes to atoms, language can only be used as poetry. What’s fascinating to me is that although we’ve learnt an incredible amount about atoms and their behaviour, our scientific journey has only just begun. Because although we know how a single atom or just a few atoms behave, the way trillions of them come together in concert to create the world around us is still largely a mystery. To give you one dramatic example, the atoms that make up my body are identical to the atoms in the rocks, the trees, the air, even the stars. And yet, they come together to create a conscious being who can ask the question, “What is an atom?” Explaining all that is surely the next great challenge in science.</em></p>
<p>I realised that the “next great challenge” he mentioned is the same one I’ve been drawn to since studying physics: the emergence of consciousness. The most intriguing question, perhaps prompted by an interesting dream I had last night, is how our mind creates the world and perceives it simultaneously when we dream. When I’m awake, I can do this partially; for instance, when I think about walking down the corridor where my office is located, I can imagine it while experiencing it at the same time. It seems this ability expands to full capacity in dreams. Once I understand that mechanism, I might be able to discern, even when awake, whether I am still dreaming and creating the world while simultaneously perceiving it.</p>

<p>Today, I rewatched the film <em>Interstellar</em>, perhaps for the fourth time. I was deeply impressed by Nolan’s previous film <em>Inception</em>, which I also probably watched five times already. Yesterday, I had to give <em>Inception</em> a 10-star rating for the first time in my life, as it just gets more interesting with every viewing. This 10-star rating is very special to me, as I have never rated any of the over 3,000 films I’ve watched so highly.</p>
<p>After this purely fantastical journey, I became curious about the science behind it. Then I realised that the scientific adviser for the film, Kip Thorne, actually wrote a book about it! I knew I had planned to read <em>Understanding Molecular Simulation</em> today, but since it’s the weekend, I decided to indulge in this investigation instead.</p>

<p>It became quite technical from Chapter 2 onward, so I only read the introduction and the discussion &amp; conclusions sections. I think I’m becoming increasingly uncertain about wanting to pursue my project. It doesn’t seem particularly mysterious or evoking my curiosity. I guess the highlight of this article was that, despite the inherent non-equilibrium mechanisms that engender phase separation and non-trivial flow patterns, the large-scale properties of the active model can be mapped onto an equilibrium one. This means that we can use techniques from equilibrium statistical mechanics, such as the renormalisation group, which I was hoping to learn deeply in my PhD.</p>
<p>If there were a connection between surface phase transitions of vapour inside the cap of my RDA (rebuildable dripping atomiser), it might be more interesting and relating to my interests, but I think this is likely an equilibrium condition rather than something relevant to active matter. <strong>I must ask next week.</strong></p>

<p>This one, too, I only read the introduction and conclusion. I wanted to read this because MIPS keeps appearing in many papers. Essentially, this phenomenon occurs because active particles generically accumulate where they move more slowly. What’s really worth noting is that the run-and-tumble model is inspired by <em>E. coli</em>, while active Brownian particles are inspired by synthetic colloids. Am I interested in either system? No… I think I should have done this activity of skimming through many papers earlier to clarify what I’m truly interested in.</p>

<p>I thought I should probably reread papers that inspired me to investigate active matter in my PhD almost a year ago. One particular article, even though it didn’t seem to attract much attention, was written by Keller: <em>‘Active Matter, Then and Now’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="keller2016active">(<a href="#ref-keller2016active" role="doc-biblioref">Keller 2016</a>)</span>. I loved reading it so much that I probably read it three times. Skipping that one this time, I started reading <em>Proliferating Active Matter</em>, which I also really enjoyed.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="ref-keller2016active" class="csl-entry" role="listitem">
Keller, Evelyn Fox. 2016. <span>“Active Matter, Then and Now.”</span> <em>History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences</em> 38: 1–11.
</div></div><p>I remember the start of the article being quite strong, mentioning the book that I often reread, <em>What Is Life?</em> by Erwin Schrödinger, and also discussing the reshaping of the chessboard by the active matter paradigm (which was probably something to do with breaking mass-reversal symmetry?)—as if I were playing the physics game like chess.</p>
<p>While reading (just before the chapter <em>Motile Proliferating Matter</em>), I got sidetracked because it wasn’t really interesting anymore. It seems my interests have shifted over the summer or possibly during the final stages of my MSci research project. It sort of makes sense when I think about it in terms of the timeline.</p>
<p>In January 2024, when I was applying for my PhD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I wanted to pursue new physics. It appeared to me that two of my favourite fields (general relativity and quantum field theory) were already well-explored and largely complete.</li>
<li>I also wanted to gain more employability skills, as I hoped to work at Google DeepMind after my PhD. I thought a computationally driven project was essential for this.</li>
<li>Eager to formally learn about the renormalisation group, I looked into areas of new physics related to it. That’s when I discovered the emerging field of active matter. After reading Keller’s account of its history and emergence, as well as McGivern’s account of how it relates to cognition (which I should probably revisit tomorrow), I thought, <em>this is it!</em> This was the field I wanted to pursue! I met Nigel, who was such a brilliant and thoughtful person to talk with, and Francesco, who had already been amazing. I applied directly (and, in fact, only applied for this PhD, while my peers were applying for multiple positions).</li>
<li>In my second term, I was also in the process of interviewing with Samsung Electronics, as they invited me to take on a data scientist role (this happened in early January, I think?). The role and salary were very attractive. However, once I received the final offer, I had to think deeply about what I truly wanted to do. There were still unsolved mysteries I hoped to explore during my PhD. I was curious about fundamental questions like: <em>What is time? What is space?</em> I thought about relativity theory and how Einstein built his ideas around the concept of a universal clock, which doesn’t depend on the mechanisms of the clock itself. But these clocks are also within a gravitational field. Can we truly justify that reading a clock on an observer’s wrist is the correct way to measure time, given that all clocks are fundamentally based on electromagnetism?</li>
<li>So, I declined the job offer and decided to stay at university for another four years. Over the summer holidays, I continued reading neuroscience books (particularly on dreams and altered states of consciousness) and considered which topics would be interesting to investigate throughout my PhD.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before sleeping, I started reading <em>Time and Quantum Clocks: A Review of Recent Developments</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="altaie2022time">(<a href="#ref-altaie2022time" role="doc-biblioref">Altaie, Hodgson, and Beige 2022</a>)</span>, which I found very interesting.</p>

<p>The next morning, I felt compelled to reread this paper, as it was one of the key works that truly ignited my interest in the field of active matter.</p>

<p>Yes! This was it! I was curious whether a simple model of active matter that I learn could be applied to biological systems by examining if they fall into the same universality class as a realistic model through the application of renormalisation group techniques.</p>
<p>Very interesting. I’m glad I read it once again. I wonder what my supervisors think about this article. I thought it would be useful to clarify whether I truly want to pursue the field of biophysics (as I’m not particularly interested in synthetic colloids), so I decided to revisit the biophysics lectures (see <a href="./notes.html#sec-biophysics-lectures">2024/11/16 Watching Biophysics Lectures</a>).</p>
