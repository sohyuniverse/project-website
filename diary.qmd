### 2024/9/27 Things I did so far

Busy weeks due to starting three teaching modules: [Weekly update of my TSR (Teaching Support Roles)](onenote:Overview.one#Links&section-id={D4B227EF-F9FF-864E-A042-9B9A7C2E06E3}&page-id={B7874627-D52D-5043-9E1A-2067E68FAD02}&object-id={537C7D03-2CEB-3142-8063-0EF93BF5A5E9}&25&base-path=https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sp13328_bristol_ac_uk/Documents/PhD%20in%20Active%20Matter). Looking back, I wish I could have completed more reading, as there isn’t much to talk about in terms of active matter research for the next project meeting on Monday.

### 2024/11/2 - 11/8 *Physics and Beyond* [@heisenberg1971physics] {#sec-physics-and-beyond}

*Cited by 1832*

It's the first time I'm reading this in English; the title of the book in Korean is 부분과 전체, which might translate to *Parts and the Whole*. I've read it many times since I was in high school, and it has been highly influential to me as a physicist throughout my life. To capture some of the things I want to revisit later:

![On page 80, Fresh Fields (1926-1927)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-04 at 09.10.47.png)

So far, having read up to page 89, it has all been interesting, except for Chapter 4 (*Lessons in Politics and History*). When the development of quantum mechanics was presented in Chapters 5 and 6, I felt my heart pounding as I read through, just as it did when I first read this book.

---

![On page 97, Atomic Physics and Pragmatism (1929)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-04 at 20.20.52.png)

All these realms were so enjoyable to learn, but now, as a researcher, I wonder what realms are still open. I thought one of them was non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, but it appears to me that this theory can't be axiomatic, implying that all systems out of equilibrium must be described differently.

![On page 109, The Relationship between Biology, Physics and Chemistry (1930-1932)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-04 at 21.20.51-down.png)

'Forms through which matter streams,' as Niels Bohr described, was the most profound characterisation of organisms I have encountered. I used to wonder, what about this structure remains? Does it actually persist, given that a person changes continuously as a child becomes an adult? Is it simply the name (person) we assign that represents this form of life? With this thought, is there really a distinction between animate and inanimate objects?

When I read *Timaeus* by Plato in high school, he described geometrical forms as the basis of earth, fire, water, and air, even though I found his idea peculiar (like everything is made of right triangles). At the time, I thought the properties that define those mathematical forms were responsible for things maintaining their structure in the way we perceive over time (since all forms change shape as time passes). My master's research was also focused on investigating this homeostasis in an ideal structure, not physical but something we perceive, in the context of foreign exchange markets. This line of thought was also captured well by Bohr’s question: "Can quantum mechanics explain nature's tendency to form structures through which matter with fixed chemical properties can stream for a limited time?"

![On page 128, Discussions about Language (1933)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 09.48.38.png)

This passage about the discovery of antimatter was one of the reasons I chose a physics degree, along with my ambition to formally study general relativity. Although I didn’t score well in my particle physics exam in third year due to a part-time job over winter break, it remains one of the most exciting units I've taken. Here are the scores and ratings I gave to my third and fourth-year units with scores of at least 4:

5: Physics Research Project (83), Quantum Physics (88)  
4.5: Physics of Phase Transitions (85), Analytical Mechanics (66), Particle Physics (58)  
4: Quantum Information Theory (68), Foundations of Modern Physics (68), Methods of Theoretical Physics (63)  

It’s surprising that general relativity only scored 3.5, but it seems I didn’t enjoy the lecture style despite being fascinated by the content.

---

![On page 134, Discussions about Language (1933)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 10.11.03.png)

This passage captures the reason I didn’t pursue a philosophy degree, despite having written about philosophy of science. What I realised was the fluidity of language, and at some point, reading philosophy felt like participating in a language game. Even when I wrote [*The Self and the World*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lGEIUBTY_RgLZfvyVO8nhSzJ_3SpVR0n1QEegImHv4g/edit?usp=sharing), I included definitions for the terms I used in the document. In contrast, I conceived mathematical objects as eternal, grounded solidly in axioms. I couldn’t imagine any language other than this to describe the hidden secrets of the universe as eternal representations, unchanging, unmoved, and concrete.

---

![On page 136, Discussions about Language (1933)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.16.00.png)

Another book I feel closely connected to is the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. It’s probably not an exaggeration to say that my whole life has been devoted to understanding the meaning of Tao, even though Lao Tzu paradoxically said, “The Tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao.” One day, I realised it is synonymous with the Truth or, in more Platonic terms, the formless. Ineffable. That’s when I wrote this diary: [Is "It" a Joke?](https://sohyuniverse.wordpress.com/2024/09/17/2023-03-27-is-it-a-joke/)

---

![On page 191, Toward a New Beginning (1941-1945)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 23.29.36.png)

These chapters were not enjoyable to read: *Revolution and University Life (1933)*, *Individual Behavior in the Face of Political Disaster (1937-1941)*, *Toward a New Beginning (1941-1945)*. I’m certainly not interested in politics or wars. However, the ending of this third chapter is beautifully written; beauty transcends ideology, opinions, and dualistic views of the world.

---

![On page 195, The Responsibility of the Scientist (1945-1950)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-06 at 10.04.36.png)

This reveals the reason why I chose the theme of *active matter*. I was curious about how this model suddenly emerged in the last 25 years. Why is there such a sudden interest in this concept? What possibilities does it offer for understanding nature? What contributions can I make to the circle of human knowledge?

---

While reading through the *Scientific and Political Disputes (1956-1957)* chapter, I realised I can only concentrate when scientific matters are being discussed, such as the conversations between Heisenberg and Wolfgang about the mathematical theory for elementary particles. 

![On page 230, The Unified Field Theory (1957-1958)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 10.33.36.png)

However, everything that followed from the passage in the image was fascinating, especially when they started discussing symmetries (for example, the universe as a whole does not necessarily have to be symmetrical with respect to the operations under which natural laws remain invariant), relativistic quantum field theories, and more, which captivated me when I studied particle physics in my third year.

---

![On page 240, Elementary Particles and Platonic Philosophy (1961-1965)](images/Physics and Beyond/Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 17.04.56-down.png)

I have finally finished the book. Although the above image is not the last page, I love this book because it begins with Plato and ends with him. *Timaeus* was the book that shaped my worldview when I was in high school, and when I first encountered *Physics and Beyond*, I was thrilled to find someone in history who asked the same questions I had while reading *Timaeus*. Since then, my understanding has deepened, and I’ve come to see that all philosophy traces back to Plato. Last year, a decade later, I finally had a direct understanding of what Plato described through some interesting experiences.

Even beyond that passage in the screenshot, it’s truly worth rereading. People at that time were already considering how natural laws conform to different scales, touching on the concept of *emergence*, which is the field I’m now working in.

While reading this book, I rewatched the documentary series *Atom*, hosted by Jim Al-Khalili. I remember watching it for the first time in high school, loving it immensely, and being struck by statements from scholars like Paul Dirac, who said, “A physical law must possess mathematical beauty.” I was curious about what QED implied once I start learning about it at university, such as how all the matter we see is just reflections of virtual particles. That was a long time ago, and that naïveté and curiosity are what led me to study physics. I’d like to close with what Jim Al-Khalili said (even though I largely disagree with his interpretation of quantum mechanics in that chapter) at the end of *The Illusion of Reality* (the third episode): 

*In the last 100 years, we have peered deep inside the atom, the basic building block of the universe. And inside this tiny object, we have found a strange new world governed by exotic laws that at times seem to defy reason. Atoms present us with dizzying contradictions. They can behave both as particles or waves. They appear to be in more than one place at the same time. They force us to rethink what we mean by past and future, by cause and effect. And they tell us strange things about where the universe came from and where it's going. Pretty amazing stuff for something that's just a millionth of a millimetre across. That's why Niels Bohr, the father of atomic physics, once said that, when it comes to atoms, language can only be used as poetry. What's fascinating to me is that although we've learnt an incredible amount about atoms and their behaviour, our scientific journey has only just begun. Because although we know how a single atom or just a few atoms behave, the way trillions of them come together in concert to create the world around us is still largely a mystery. To give you one dramatic example, the atoms that make up my body are identical to the atoms in the rocks, the trees, the air, even the stars. And yet, they come together to create a conscious being who can ask the question, “What is an atom?” Explaining all that is surely the next great challenge in science.*

I realised that the “next great challenge” he mentioned is the same one I’ve been drawn to since studying physics: the emergence of consciousness. The most intriguing question, perhaps prompted by an interesting dream I had last night, is how our mind creates the world and perceives it simultaneously when we dream. When I'm awake, I can do this partially; for instance, when I think about walking down the corridor where my office is located, I can imagine it while experiencing it at the same time. It seems this ability expands to full capacity in dreams. Once I understand that mechanism, I might be able to discern, even when awake, whether I am still dreaming and creating the world while simultaneously perceiving it.

### 2024/11/4 Diary {#sec-week8-diary}

I was quite ill last week, taking antibiotics from Monday to Saturday. While having more rest at home than in other weeks, I was thinking about a few things.

1. At first, I started thinking about why I began to study physics. It was driven by mysteries and curiosities. At that time, I didn't know that what I was going to learn were representations of empirical observations; rather, I naively thought it would be the objective truth. As I was learning physics in my undergraduate studies, I realised there are different mathematical formalisms to describe the same physical phenomena, such as Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics in classical physics, or matrix mechanics by Heisenberg and wave mechanics by Schrödinger in quantum mechanics. Then my approach to physics became more like, 'Which model makes the most sense to me for understanding the observed?' or 'Which models lead to more universal descriptions of all things?' Then I encountered the concept of universality: many of the microscopic details that go into the theory are irrelevant under successive renormalisation group transformations; the theory that describes the critical point is *universal*. I thought this idea was stunningly beautiful, and I thought that if I were to start my PhD, I would investigate how these patterns that interlace between different systems or physical theories emerge.
2. Then, as I was ill and thinking about many things, I reflected on what has captivated me in my undergraduate studies. The list follows like this:

- Year 1, The breakdown of the concept, simultaneity: As I was learning special relativity, I realised that the notion I thought was objective was actually subjective. The only way to know what time is is to look at the clock. This idea was profound for me, emphasising that time is not an absolute entity. Einstein's theory was so elegant in the way that it started with only two assumptions: first, the speed of light is constant based on empirical observations; second, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. The consequences of the theory based on these assumptions were just mind-blowing.
- Year 2, first term, quantum tunnelling: I was always fascinated by the implications of quantum mechanics even before starting my physics degree. Once I was able to explain the phenomenon of the wavefunction trapped in a finite potential well, which allows for the probability of finding a particle on the other side of the barrier, it was really mind-blowing that I clearly understood the mathematics but had no idea how to comprehend it, even though this phenomenon is the foundation of all technologies I use now.
- Year 2, second term, Maxwell's equations: The universal descriptions that entail all electromagnetic phenomena in such simple mathematical forms using vector calculus. I was struck by the beauty of these equations that I set them as a screensaver since my second year. Also, when I went to Edinburgh and saw a statue of Maxwell with his equations, I couldn't leave that place for a long time.
- Year 3, second term, the principle of least action: This whole Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics was the clearest and the deepest representation I had encountered. The path is chosen to extremise the action, which was such a profound perspective that changed all my ways of thinking. I could go on and on about this, but in short, I loved the encounter with this concept so much that I used it as a nickname on several websites.
- Year 4, first term, the whole ideas from general relativity: This subject was of tremendous importance to me. When I decided to study physics, this was the subject I intended to study and also the reason I chose the MSci, as it was a unit for fourth-year students. I would say this is the subject which made me come to university. The idea that if we also include a time axis overlaid onto three spatial axes, an object at rest in a given reference frame moves at the speed of light along the time axis. Then, if an object moves, since the magnitude of speed is bound by the speed of light, the component that lies on the time axis decreases as it increases along the spatial axes. It was such a beautiful way of describing how time and space were interlinked. Also, the calculus of variations, which led to Lagrangian mechanics that I loved, started from considering the straight line in a global perspective. Einstein's theory started with thinking about the straight line (or rather more precisely, a vector) from a local perspective with parallel transport. The implication of this led to Einstein's field equations, which imply matter tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells matter how to move. These whole ideas related very closely to some of my psychedelic experiences, and I thought it was THE subject I would want to learn much more deeply in the coming years, before I met the language of the physics of phase transitions.
- Year 4, second term, the whole ideas from the physics of phase transitions: the correlation length diverging at criticality, universality classes, and critical exponents telling how to rescale a physical theory. All these ideas were so captivating that it almost felt like meta-foundational physics, like the physics of physical theory. Also, a lot of concepts extended even beyond the realm of physics, such as the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience. This perspective of considering the structure of physical theory was like the final lesson of my undergraduate studies and the one that I wanted to pursue for the rest of my physics career. At that time, I met Nigel, my supervisor, who told me that in statistical physics, a small number of people make a great contribution to the field, unlike astrophysicists or particle physicists who are in large groups and don't get to decide the direction. That was the moment I felt that I chose the field of statistical physics, even though I have loved concepts from astrophysics (general relativity) and particle physics (quantum field theory).

3. Now I'm in week 8 of my PhD, but I can't say that I have been really engaged with my research. The biggest fault is down to me: I haven't read references thoroughly so that I can appreciate the field in general yet. I'm the person who likes to read one book over and over again (and it seems that the only professor who likes to do this is Sandu Popescu), but I am kind of overwhelmed by how many references were uploaded in Zotero and the time it takes for me to read *understanding molecular simulation*. And I haven't found a way to convince my supervisors about my progress since I also have had a lot of teaching responsibilities so far. I can only tell them that it will take time, but at the same time, since my progress is slow, I also haven't found a profound interest in this field as I had in my undergraduate studies above. For this year, no matter how long it takes, I fully want to understand this field first by reading that book, learn the common languages that we use, then read all those references to appreciate before I jump into the serious research. But every time in project meetings, I somehow feel that I need to defend myself about what I'm doing when there are piles of things to do accumulating. In short, I feel overwhelmed.

4. That was the reason that my rest has been quite different and sidetracked this time in week 7. I started reading *Physics and Beyond* written by Werner Heisenberg (see [2024/11/2 - 11/8 *Physics and Beyond*](reading.qmd#sec-physics-and-beyond)). This book was the one that I always consulted whenever there were uncertainties about my physics career path. I am on page 108 now out of 268. I want to finish this book first before jumping into reading *Understanding Molecular Simulation* again, but at the same time, I feel sorry for my supervisors who believe in my progress in my PhD. It's all difficult now in terms of my situation.

### 2024/11/5 Being a Good Lecturer

After attending [Hermes](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Hermes-Gadelha-d024bd20-e1b7-4c53-af70-94acac5c6425/)' lecture, I realised there are certain qualities that a very good lecturer shares. To describe him:

He was smiling, making jokes, honest, sharing life stories, and, most importantly, engaging with students at their level.

Often, when I talk with certain lecturers or fellow physics PGRs, they ramble without checking if the person listening is following. Then, it becomes nothing more than loud diary entries or a display of their knowledge.

I also felt that the language barrier was irrelevant. Hermes had pronunciation difficulties, like me, but he simply let it go, laughing it off rather than taking it too seriously.

I was quite surprised by how many qualities he actually shared with another of my favourite lecturers, Sandu Popescu. His English isn’t perfect, and he speaks slowly, but it always feels like there is something worth listening to. Also, like Hermes, who wrote on paper, he used the blackboard or whiteboard instead of showing endless slides.

Hermes made plenty of eye contact and made excellent use of pauses during his explanations, allowing students to form images in their minds for better understanding.

There was much for me to learn from his approach to lecturing. I thought I was already a good lecturer, one that many students like, but I realised he was truly an inspiration.

### 2024/11/9 - The Science of Interstellar [@thorne2014science]

*Cited by 265*

Today, I rewatched the film *Interstellar*, perhaps for the fourth time. I was deeply impressed by Nolan's previous film *Inception*, which I also probably watched five times already. Yesterday, I had to give *Inception* a 10-star rating for the first time in my life, as it just gets more interesting with every viewing. This 10-star rating is very special to me, as I have never rated any of the over 3,000 films I've watched so highly.

After this purely fantastical journey, I became curious about the science behind it. Then I realised that the scientific adviser for the film, Kip Thorne, actually wrote a book about it! I knew I had planned to read *Understanding Molecular Simulation* today, but since it’s the weekend, I decided to indulge in this investigation instead.

![On page 45, 4. Warped Time and Space, and Tidal Gravity](images/The Science of Interstella/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 23.42.51.png)

What a beautiful way of interpreting general relativity! 

So far, having read up to Chapter 6, it has all been very interesting! But since Monday has arrived, it’s time to focus on my project again...

### 2024/11/17 The Moment of My Realisation {#sec-equality-sign}

<div style="background-color: #fdf6e3; padding: 1.5em; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif, monospace; margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; background-color: #fdf7e4; border-radius: 5px;">
The reason Einstein’s theory is beautiful is because it’s the ULTIMATE PATTERN!

Space and time are interlinked!<br>
Energy and mass are the same!<br>
Mass is equal to frequency!<sup>1</sup><br>
The beauty of mathematics was that ‘equality’ sign!  

Just a very simple relationship revealed by mathematics!  
That was the whole purpose of physics!  
No matter what complicated language we use to describe concepts,  
There comes the language of physics: “They are the same!”  

I cannot stop laughing.  

“Stop arguing! They are the same!”  

The reason the renormalisation group naively appeared as beautiful was because, as we went to higher levels of description, we somehow discovered: ‘Oh! They are the same!’

Now it all makes sense.  

The reason the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem was beautiful was because it linked modular forms to elliptic curves! They are the same!  
The reason Euler’s relation is beautiful is because it links $e$, $\pi$, $i$, and $-1$!  
The reason criticality is beautiful is because the Ising model and liquid-gas model, ‘only’ at the critical point, are the same! Hence the name ‘Universality’!  
The reason Maxwell’s equations are beautiful is because they show that electric fields and magnetic fields are the same! The whole phenomenon you’ve been looking at, which you thought was different, is just the same!  
The reason nature is beautiful is because it is the same thing! Not different things! The breath of perceiving their sameness!  

The driving motivation for me in my MSci was to say: ‘Hey! The market and the brain are THE SAME!’

I've been just chasing this beauty for my entire lifetime!

I shared this diary with ChatGPT, asking the question: *‘The above is my diary, and I realised that the beauty we feel comes from the equality sign! When we recognise the sameness in the different high-level structures of models, we feel the beauty! Are there any scholars who have noticed this?’*

Here was a kind response I received:

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer!</summary>

Yes, the notion of "sameness" across seemingly disparate structures has long fascinated scholars across various disciplines. The diary entry you've shared resonates deeply with ideas explored in physics, mathematics, philosophy, and even cognitive science. Scholars have discussed the aesthetic appeal of discovering unifying principles expressed through equalities, symmetries, or mappings across different domains.

Here are a few examples of scholars and their thoughts that align with your reflections:

1. **Hermann Weyl**: In *Symmetry* (1952), Weyl extensively discusses the beauty inherent in mathematical symmetry and its unifying power across different physical phenomena. He was captivated by the way symmetry provides insight into the sameness of different structures.

2. **Eugene Wigner**: His essay *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences* (1960) explores the mysterious and seemingly miraculous ability of mathematics to describe natural phenomena, suggesting that this effectiveness stems from the deep unity (or sameness) in the laws governing different systems.

3. **Philip Anderson**: In his paper *More is Different* (1972), Anderson discusses the concept of emergence and universality in physics, emphasising how high-level behaviours often reflect underlying similarities (e.g., critical phenomena in phase transitions).

4. **Roger Penrose**: Penrose, particularly in *The Road to Reality* (2004), highlights the elegance of mathematical relationships like Euler's formula and their role in unveiling deep truths about the universe.

5. **Noam Chomsky** (in linguistics and cognitive science): Chomsky's ideas about "deep structure" in human language propose that surface differences in languages mask an underlying sameness—a universal grammar.

6. **Benoît Mandelbrot**: Mandelbrot's work on fractals emphasises the beauty of self-similarity in nature, where complex structures emerge from simple iterative rules, demonstrating a unifying pattern.

Your observation about the equality sign being a source of beauty is profound and aligns with discussions in the philosophy of mathematics. Scholars like Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, in *Principia Mathematica*, discuss the foundational role of relations (like equality) in mathematical structures.

In contemporary interdisciplinary work, the pursuit of identifying "sameness" across domains is central to fields like network theory (e.g., mapping similarities between neural networks and market behaviours), which directly aligns with your reflections on the market and the brain.

Your diary elegantly captures a timeless insight: the beauty of science and mathematics often lies in the revelation that what seems different is, at its core, the same.

### 2024/11/23 16personalities

[My personal report](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/7fa311c44b21a)

Since someone kept asking... not that I care about it. I thought this categorisation was only popular in South Korea, but maybe that's not the case anymore. What's slightly interesting is that it revealed the same type as when I did it a few years ago, so it seems there is a conservative quantity in my traits. The one who asked me read the report and said, "Unquenchable thirst for knowledge!!!!!!! That's you!!!"

### 2024/11/25 Stuck in Bristol

Yesterday, [Storm Bert](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-latest-updates-on-storm-bert) disrupted all trains to London, preventing me from travelling to my hotel. As a result, I can no longer attend the Statistical Physics of Cognition conference in person. While I will still join via Zoom, yesterday was so frustrating that all I could do was laugh. It felt like the best thing to do under the circumstances! Strangely, it almost felt as though I was hearing a voice saying, "Stop focusing on neuroscience for now! Embrace your project!"

These are the notes I wrote for cancelling the rail tickets through Clarity (for future reference):

> I am requesting a refund for this ticket. When I arrived at Clifton Down station at 3:50 pm, I waited 15 minutes only to find out that the train to Bristol Temple Meads had been cancelled. I then took an Uber costing £19.92 to the station, where I discovered that my connecting train was also cancelled. Later, at 8:00 pm, I learned that all trains to eastern destinations, including London, were cancelled due to heavy storms. I have a screenshot as proof and can provide it upon request via email.

This was my expense claim made through MyERP:

> The train at 4:02 pm from Clifton Down was cancelled, and it was urgent to take a taxi to Bristol Temple Meads as the train was supposed to arrive at 4:30 pm. Sadly, when I went to Temple Meads, this train was also cancelled. I am claiming this expense as I was on my way to the conference; please refer to my past claims made through Clarity.<br><br>
> Another update: the train that goes to all eastern destinations, including London, was cancelled, and I only found out at 8 pm. I cancelled my hotel and train bookings through Clarity. Many chaotic events occurred while I was at Temple Meads, and I eventually ended up at Bristol Parkway. I took a bus to Gloucester Road and then came home by Uber.

When I got home, I had a phone call with my mum and shared how much the situation had changed. Reflecting on what I said to her:

While I was at the train station for hours, I found myself thinking deeply about my project, the papers I read last week, and my conversations with Nigel and Ian. I realised that my project presents a perfect opportunity to learn about useful concepts for describing non-equilibrium systems, such as entropy production, the Fokker–Planck equation, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Now, investigating these concepts using the simplest models from the particle perspective of active matter feels really exciting! If a drying transition is observed, it will also be a great chance to master the theoretical understanding and application of renormalisation group techniques.

Reading various papers helped me appreciate how interesting colloids and bacteria can be. Bacteria represent the simplest form of living systems, and through motility-induced phase separation, these systems form large-scale structures without any attractive interactions. Thinking about surface phase transitions became particularly intriguing when I considered how 3D structures form 2D boundaries. Boundaries are key to how we differentiate objects. Even in comics, we draw the boundaries of characters and objects. This perspective made the topic even more interesting.

I also admire how my supervisors approached the problem, using an order parameter to measure the asymmetry within the capillary system. This method effectively avoids the complexities of defining surface tensions and focuses instead on the geometrical aspects of the problem. Once these ideas crystallised in my mind, I felt certain that I wanted to become an expert in this field. If someone asks about surface phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems, I want to be the person they turn to for advice.

These thoughts were swirling in my mind, and strangely, the weather even stopped me from travelling to London to attend the Statistical Physics of Cognition conference, where I had planned to network with people in that field. I don’t believe in mystical things, but the timing was mysterious. This kind of weather disruption, preventing travel between cities, hasn’t happened to me in my five years living in the UK.

I was also thinking about Nigel and Francesco and how thoughtful they both are. I want to become a light that brightens the path for us.

### 2024/11/27 IQ Test

While watching the Statistical Physics of Cognition conference, there was a talk about *statistical learning*, which I found very interesting. In the evening, I watched a Korean TV show, 대학전쟁 (translated as *The University War*?), a survival game genre that mostly features puzzles and problem-solving, which I always enjoy watching. It reminded me of my favourite show, [The Genius](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4597194/).

Coincidentally, both mentioned IQ tests. I remember taking one as a teenager; it was quite high, though I couldn’t recall the exact number. I think it was around 153, as I remember this number being interesting:

$$
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3

But my memory is not clear. So, I decided to try a simple test provided here: [IQ Test Made by Mensa Norway](https://test.mensa.no/Home/Test/en-GB).

There were some questions that were unclear or took a long time to solve, so I captured those:

![Exercise 23](images/notes/IQ Test/Screenshot 2024-11-27 at 12.34.21.png)

I spent quite a few minutes on this one. There seemed to be some dynamic rules; if I name the cells 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 9:

1. The black circle is straightforward: it moves to the left across the cells, such as 1 → 2 → 3, or 1 → 4 → 7.
2. The cell containing the black square moves diagonally to the left, such as 1 → 6 → 8, while the black square itself shifts left within the cell.

Once I identified these rules, I realised that the black triangle and white square follow the same rule as the black square. So, I chose **F**. It took some time to recheck if I had made any mistakes.

Up to this exercise, all the questions had been pretty easy, and I still had more than 10 minutes remaining. However, I spent the most time on this one. My solution process was as follows:

1. As the cell moves diagonally to the left, such as 1 → 6 → 8, the triangle at the bottom-right flips first (1 → 6), and then the triangle at the top-left flips (6 → 8).
2. When the cell moves diagonally to the left along 3 → 5 → 7, the triangle at the top-right flips first (3 → 5), and then the triangle at the bottom-left flips (5 → 7).
3. Finally, for the path 2 → 4 → 9, the top-right triangle flips to hide a white triangle (2 → 4). Then, for 4 → 9, the bottom-left triangle flips.

Therefore, I chose **E**, though I am uncertain if this answer is correct. There seemed to be some inconsistencies: for example, in steps 2 and 3, the top-right triangle flips as the cells progress along a row, but for step 1, it is the bottom-right triangle that flips. I attempted to identify more consistent dynamic rules but couldn’t, so this question took the most time.

This one wasn’t difficult, but it introduced a new type of question, making it fun to solve. The reason I chose **A** was:

1. The black circle always covers the white circle.
2. When the two white circles move counterclockwise across the column (e.g., 1 → 2 → 3 or 4 → 5 → 6), they do not overlap. For example, the two white circles initially positioned at the bottom-left in 1 move to the bottom-right in 2 without overlapping, and as they move from 2 to 3, they shift to the top without overlapping.
3. The black circle’s rule operates independently of the white circles. The cell containing the black circle moves diagonally (e.g., 1 → 6 → 8), but the black circle itself remains in the same relative position (the 9 o’clock direction).

The reason I chose **A** was because the cell containing the black circle moved from 2 → 4 → 9, while the two white circles moved from 7 → 8 → 9. Since the black circle covered the white circle in the 9 o’clock direction, the answer **A** was clear.

![Exercise 35](images/notes/IQ Test/Screenshot 2024-11-27 at 12.46.43.png)

This one took the second-longest time after Exercise 33. Here are the rules I inferred:

1. The equality sign (=) moves diagonally to the right along 2 → 6 → 7.
2. The upper triangle (∧) moves diagonally to the right along 3 → 4 → 7.
3. The lower triangle (∨) moves diagonally to the right along 1 → 5 → 9 and also diagonally to the left along 1 → 6 → 8.
4. The two walls (|   |) move diagonally to the left along 2 → 4 → 9.

However, the explanation for the lower triangle (∨) in point 3 felt somewhat ad hoc. I tried to identify another dynamic rule but could not. Based on the above reasoning, the answer **D** was the most plausible.

I used about 23 minutes and 30 seconds in total.

Oh wow! I’m not sure what the maximum score on this test is, but it roughly suggests that my IQ is still 145 or more. It seems that the theoretical maximum score a person can achieve with a standard deviation of 15 is 160 (source: [나무위키: 지능지수](https://namu.wiki/w/지능%20지수?from=IQ#s-5.1)). If I do some simple mathematics, the IQ test follows a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. My score of 145 gives a z-score of:

$$
z = \frac{145 - 100}{15} = 3
$$

From the z-score, I calculated the cumulative probability using the normal distribution and found it to be 99.87%. This means I am in the top 0.13% of the population.

To convert this score to the $N(100, 24^2)$ standard (which appears to be the standard in Mensa Korea), which uses a standard deviation of 24:

$$
\text{IQ}_{24} = 100 + 3 \times 24 = 172
$$
