### 2024/10/2 Why are the clouds at the same height when I look at the cloudy sky?

![View from Brandon Hill](images/notes/View%20from%20Brandon%20Hill.jpg)

When we observe clouds appearing at the same height, it's often due to a phenomenon where a particular layer of the atmosphere has the right conditions for cloud formation. In the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere), clouds form when the air cools to its dew point, causing water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. This typically happens at specific altitudes where temperature and pressure conditions are ideal for condensation.

Clouds that seem to form at the same height are likely part of the same atmospheric layer, known as a *cloud base*. The cloud base marks the altitude at which rising air reaches its dew point. If the conditions across the sky are uniform, we’ll see many clouds forming at roughly the same altitude, giving the illusion of a flat layer of clouds.

Cloud formation is fundamentally a non-equilibrium process. It results from dynamic atmospheric conditions like rising air currents, changes in temperature and pressure, and the continuous exchange of energy. These factors drive processes such as condensation and evaporation, which are inherently out of equilibrium. This aligns with the behaviour of active matter systems, where each particle consumes energy to move, keeping the system perpetually out of equilibrium.

To create an effective repulsion in our ABP simulations, we consider modifying the wall-fluid interactions to induce a torque that reorients particles away from the surface. One approach might be to introduce an anisotropic interaction potential near the wall. When an ABP approaches the surface, this potential could apply a torque that turns the particle's propulsion direction away from the wall, effectively reducing its tendency to accumulate there.

*I wasn’t sure how to implement this, so I asked ChatGPT.*

<summary>Click to reveal the answer!</summary>

Implementing this in a molecular dynamics simulation involves adding a torque term to the equations of motion for particles near the wall. By carefully tuning the strength and range of this torque, you can simulate an effective repulsion. This may enable the system to undergo a drying transition, analogous to how insufficient moisture and rising warm air can prevent cloud formation below a certain altitude. Studying how this modification affects the phase behaviour of the system could provide insights into the critical properties of the drying transition in active matter.

Let's delve into the mathematical approach to create an effective repulsion between active Brownian particles (ABPs) and a surface by introducing a torque that reorients particles away from the wall.

#### 1. **Modelling Active Brownian Particles**

ABPs are particles that propel themselves with a constant speed $v_0$ in a direction $\mathbf{u}_i$, which changes due to rotational diffusion. The equations of motion for an ABP in two dimensions are:

- **Translational Motion:**

  $$ 
  \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = v_0 \mathbf{u}_i + \mu \mathbf{F}_i + \sqrt{2D_t} \boldsymbol{\eta}_i(t)
  $$

- **Rotational Motion:**

  $$ 
  \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \sqrt{2D_r} \xi_i(t)
  $$

  where:
  - $\mathbf{r}_i$ is the position of particle $i$,
  - $\mathbf{u}_i = (\cos\theta_i, \sin\theta_i)$ is the unit vector in the propulsion direction,
  - $\mu$ is the mobility,
  - $\mathbf{F}_i$ is the force acting on the particle,
  - $D_t$ and $D_r$ are the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients,
  - $\boldsymbol{\eta}_i(t)$ and $\xi_i(t)$ are Gaussian white noise terms.

#### 2. **Introducing Wall-Induced Torque**

To induce effective repulsion, we modify the rotational dynamics by adding a torque term $\tau_i$ that depends on the particle's proximity and orientation relative to the wall.

- **Modified Rotational Motion:**

  $$ 
  \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \tau_i + \sqrt{2D_r} \xi_i(t)
  $$

##### **Defining the Torque $\tau_i$**

The torque should reorient particles away from the wall when they are close to it. A simple way to define $\tau_i$ is:

1. **Calculate the Angle Between Particle Orientation and Wall Normal:**

   - Let $\mathbf{n}$ be the wall normal vector (pointing into the fluid).
   - The angle between $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{n}$ is $\phi_i$, where:

     $$
     \cos\phi_i = \mathbf{u}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}
     $$

2. **Define the Torque Based on Orientation:**

   - Set the torque to be proportional to $\sin\phi_i$, which is maximal when $\mathbf{u}_i$ is parallel to the wall and zero when it's perpendicular.
   - Include a spatial dependency $f(\mathbf{r}_i)$ that activates the torque only near the wall.

   $$
   \tau_i = -\kappa f(\mathbf{r}_i) \sin\phi_i
   $$

   where:
   - $\kappa$ is the torque strength,
   - $f(\mathbf{r}_i)$ is a function that decays with distance from the wall, e.g.:

     $$
     f(\mathbf{r}_i) = \exp\left(-\frac{d_i}{\lambda}\right)
     $$

     with $d_i$ being the distance of particle $i$ from the wall, and $\lambda$ a decay length scale.

#### 3. **Implementing Effective Repulsion**

- **Net Effect:** The torque $\tau_i$ causes particles near the wall to turn away from it, reducing the likelihood of accumulation at the surface.

- **Adjusting Parameters:** By tuning $\kappa$ and $\lambda$, you control the strength and range of the effective repulsion.

#### 4. **Mathematical Formulation of the Wall Interaction**

##### **Potential Approach**

Alternatively, you can define an orientation-dependent wall potential $U(\mathbf{r}_i, \theta_i)$:

$$
U(\mathbf{r}_i, \theta_i) = U_0 f(\mathbf{r}_i) \left[1 - \cos(\phi_i)\right]
$$

- **Force from the Potential:**

  $$
  \mathbf{F}_i^\text{wall} = -\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U(\mathbf{r}_i, \theta_i)
  $$

- **Torque from the Potential:**

  $$
  \tau_i = -\frac{\partial U(\mathbf{r}_i, \theta_i)}{\partial \theta_i}
  $$

#### 5. **Modified Equations of Motion Near the Wall**

Combining the translational and rotational equations with the wall-induced torque:

- **Translational Motion:**

  $$
  \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = v_0 \mathbf{u}_i + \mu \left( \mathbf{F}_i^\text{wall} + \mathbf{F}_i^\text{int} \right) + \sqrt{2D_t} \boldsymbol{\eta}_i(t)
  $$

- **Rotational Motion:**

  $$
  \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = -\kappa f(\mathbf{r}_i) \sin\phi_i + \sqrt{2D_r} \xi_i(t)
  $$

  where $\mathbf{F}_i^\text{int}$ includes interparticle forces.

#### 6. **Simulation Implementation**

- **Algorithm Steps:**
  1. **Compute Distances:** For each particle, calculate $d_i$ and $\phi_i$.
  2. **Evaluate Torque and Forces:** Use $f(\mathbf{r}_i)$ to compute $\tau_i$ and $\mathbf{F}_i^\text{wall}$.
  3. **Update Rotations:** Integrate the rotational equation to update $\theta_i$.
  4. **Update Positions:** Integrate the translational equation to update $\mathbf{r}_i$.

- **Numerical Integration:** Use appropriate time-stepping methods (e.g., Euler-Maruyama) that handle stochastic differential equations.

#### 7. **Analysing the Drying Transition**

##### **Order Parameter:**

Define an order parameter $m$ that quantifies the local density near the wall:

$$
m = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Theta(d_c - d_i)
$$

- $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function,
- $d_c$ is a cutoff distance defining the near-wall region.

##### **Phase Behaviour:**

- **Dry Phase:** Low $m$, indicating few particles near the wall.
- **Wet Phase:** High $m$, indicating accumulation at the wall.

##### **Criticality and Scaling:**

- **Susceptibility:**

  $$
  \chi = N \left( \langle m^2 \rangle - \langle m \rangle^2 \right)
  $$

- **Correlation Length:** Analyse spatial correlations of particle density perpendicular to the wall.

- **Finite-Size Scaling:** Perform simulations for different system sizes $L$ to study scaling behavior near the transition.

#### 8. **Connection to Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics**

- **Effective Temperature:** In active systems, define an effective temperature $T_\text{eff}$ related to activity.

- **Detailed Balance Violation:** The presence of torque and self-propulsion breaks detailed balance, characteristic of non-equilibrium systems.

#### 9. **Relation to Cloud Formation**

- **Non-Equilibrium Nature:** Just as cloud formation involves dynamic, non-equilibrium processes (e.g., condensation driven by temperature gradients), the drying transition in ABPs emerges from non-equilibrium dynamics due to activity and torque-induced reorientation.

- **Threshold Conditions:** Both phenomena involve surpassing critical thresholds—supersaturation for clouds and torque strength for drying.

#### **Summary**

By mathematically incorporating a torque that depends on particle orientation and proximity to the wall, we induce an effective repulsion in ABPs. This modification alters the surface interactions, potentially leading to a drying transition. The approach involves:

- Modifying the rotational equation of motion with a torque term.
- Defining the torque to reorient particles away from the wall.
- Implementing the model in simulations to observe changes in phase behavior.
- Analyzing the system using statistical mechanics tools to characterize the transition.

This mathematical framework provides a pathway to explore how activity and modified interactions can lead to novel surface phenomena in active matter systems.

### 2024/10/5 An idea of beginning the introduction

This thesis is ultimately about phase transitions. The central question is: what happens during a transition, for example, from water to ice, from a fluid to a superfluid, or from a paramagnet to a ferromagnet? The physics of such transitions is rich and complex. There are a number of different theoretical tools available to understand them. The study begins by examining thermodynamics and extends to the application of statistical mechanics to these transitions. Additionally, statistical field theory, a fully-fledged field theory similar to what is seen in particle physics or general relativity, will be applied. The goal is to use these approaches, along with concepts of symmetry and other properties, to understand different phases of matter.

For a long time, understanding phase transitions was a mystery, especially what's known as a critical point. It's an interesting situation: we have something as familiar as water, and it was not until the mid-20th century that significant progress was made. The phase behaviour of water can be examined using a pressure-temperature diagram:

![Phase diagram of water [@cmglee_phase_diagram]](images/notes/Phase_diagram_of_water_simplified.svg)

- On the horizontal axis is temperature, and on the vertical axis is pressure.
- The phase diagram for water features three regions: steam, water, and ice.
- There's a point called the triple point, where all three phases coexist, and a critical point, which marks the end of the liquid-gas boundary.

Water is essential, as most of us are mostly water, and yet the physics of what happens at this critical point wasn't understood for the longest time. It's a system that is incredibly close to us, yet to understand it requires some of the deepest ideas in physics, particularly the renormalisation group.

In this sense, phase transitions form a uniquely positioned subject. They are simultaneously very close to our everyday experience and yet require extremely deep ideas to understand properly. Most other areas of physics are typically far removed from daily life. Quantum mechanics operates on microscopic scales, and astrophysics on cosmological scales, both far from what can be intuitively grasped. But here, some really deep, beautiful puzzles are found in the world around us.

### 2024/10/7 Weekly project meeting

#### Things to discuss

1. Overleaf template for the thesis, as I will start writing what I learn for either the introduction or theory sections. Found one: [Link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-bristol-thesis-template/kzqrfvyxxcdm)

### 2024/10/8 Analytical Mechanics

I've been watching Tom's lectures on Analytical Mechanics once more. I’ve just finished part 2. The topics are:

1. Calculus of variations
2. Lagrangian mechanics
3. Hamiltonian mechanics

Why did I start watching it?

Well, during the last project meeting, I had a naïve question about whether we could formulate a Lagrangian for the drying scenario. For example, in my supervisor's papers, they couldn't manage to observe the drying transition in their setup. So, I asked if, when the trajectory of all particles is away from the surface, we could possibly derive an analytical equation of forces between the particles and the wall to induce torque. Just a pure naïve idea.

Nigel mentioned that the principle of least action makes sense in equilibrium settings, so I had to revise that concept. The Lagrangian is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy, whatever this quantity is. In non-equilibrium systems, energy keeps changing since active agents continuously consume energy. Also, the effective potential depends on the properties of the wall. So, the Lagrangian would become time-dependent, which now makes sense based on what Nigel said.

The beautiful theorem was revisited from his lectures: **Noether's theorem**.

- If the laws of physics don't depend on time, energy is conserved.
- Similarly, if the system has translational or rotational invariance, momentum or angular momentum is conserved, respectively.

This is beautiful: conserved quantities derive from the symmetries of the system. It also implies that since energy is *not* conserved for the system I'm interested in, the equations of motion would be time-dependent. I think it would be useful to pay attention to how the equations of motion for active Brownian particles are formulated once I revise their papers.

As for his lectures, I’ll continue with part 3 since I've already watched the first two. That said, I remember his lecture notes being better than the video recordings, although his video lectures on phase transitions were much more inspiring. So, a note for my future self: when revising the content of the analytical formulation of mechanics, read his lecture notes.

#### Programs I made

Before doing that, I made a Python program that:

1. downloads all lectures from Mediasite from the unit I select,
2. detects and removes sections of silence in both the video and audio tracks, applying a buffer of 0.5 seconds before and after each silence to make the transitions smoother,
3. syncs the video and audio together seamlessly to create an mp4 file (the original files were mov, which were almost 10x larger in size),
4. keeps the system active throughout the process by using `caffeinate` to prevent the computer from going to sleep,
5. tracks and reports the download status, ensuring that any interrupted downloads are handled smoothly by automatically updating cookies for authentication,
6. ensures frame rate consistency to avoid any sync issues that might arise due to different frame rates,
7. automatically manages temporary files created during the silence detection process, keeping the system clean after the task is done.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share this code on GitHub, but it was a fun project.

![Downloaded lectures](images/notes/Screenshot%202024-10-08%20at%2017.47.53.png)

Why did I make it? Because...

- I’ve always felt lazy logging into Blackboard (the university website) every time I wanted to watch videos during my undergraduate years.
- I personally wanted to collect the lectures before they disappeared from the website.
- There are many pauses in the lectures where the lecturer doesn't speak while writing equations or words. Removing these pauses also saves total viewing time. Observe the difference:

**Total time to watch all videos of AM (Analytical Mechanics):**

- AM: 9 hours, 18 minutes, 34 seconds
- Processed_AM: 8 hours, 23 minutes, 50 seconds
- Processed_AM (no buffer of 0.5s): 7 hours, 23 minutes, 28 seconds

**Total time to watch all videos of PT (Physics of Phase Transitions):**

- PT: 11 hours, 42 minutes, 19 seconds
- Processed_PT: 10 hours, 49 minutes, 18 seconds
- Processed_PT (no buffer of 0.5s): 9 hours, 45 minutes, 29 seconds

The buffer is necessary as it makes the transitions feel more natural by introducing a brief pause rather than cutting the silences completely. Watch an example below (duration change: 18:09 (before processing) → 15:29 (after processing with buffers)):

![AM 2.5a Noether's Theorem](videos/notes/processed_AM 2.5a Noether's Theorem.mp4)

A beautiful quote from Tom: 

*From AM 3.4, classical mechanics is the geometry of phase space. All of the geometries (symplectic form, canonical transformations, etc.) describe the phenomenology of classical mechanics.*

## Week 6

### 2024/10/23 Molsim-2025 School Application

[MolSim-2025](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/molsim-2025-1335) is 2-week school that offers a program focusing on basic and advanced molecular simulation methods. It targets PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers who want to understand and apply these methods to study topics in physics, chemistry or biology. The program has an integrated and balanced structure of lectures and hands-on exercises. It offers a recap of the basic theory relevant for molecular simulation, followed by a thorough covering of basic and advanced simulation techniques. All techniques will be accompanied by illustrative examples of present day research.

#### My application (submitted on 241023)

I am a PhD student in theoretical and computational physics at the University of Bristol, specialising in the simulation of surface phase transitions with a focus on active matter using high-performance computing. My supervisors are Nigel Wilding, who has strongly recommended this winter school and has done substantial work on developing efficient algorithms for MC simulations [1-4], and Francesco Turci, who specialises in disordered systems. My initial project involves investigating drying (surface) phase transitions using Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics techniques, introducing an additional parameter to how they approached the problem in PRL 2021 [5].

I am highly motivated to join this winter school since it is my first year of PhD studies and also my first time learning how to conduct molecular simulations. I am currently reading the book *Understanding Molecular Simulation* to grasp the methodologies, and I was very excited by the fact that the authors of this book will be present for the lectures. Even though this book is enjoyable to read, many concepts within it are quite new to me, so it will be a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge in this area and meet colleagues with similar interests. The latter reason is also very important since I am the only PhD student learning models of active particles for surface phase transitions in my department.

Please let me know if you would like me to send my CV. For now, I have attached my personal statement, which I submitted for my PhD application, showing my dynamic and multifaceted experience. I hope this wonderful opportunity will materialise.

## Week 7

### 2024/10/28 Weekly project meeting

#### Things to discuss

1. My plan over a few days: reading two papers by Lloyd Demetrius, as this week’s fluids and materials seminar sounds very interesting and takes place on 31 October. The title and abstract are as follows:

Lloyd Demetriou, Thurs 31st Oct, 14:00-15:00, G.07

Title: The evolutionary dynamics of collective behaviour: From inorganic matter to living matter

Abstract: 
Collective behaviour of the atoms and molecules in inorganic matter is described by the statistical parameter thermodynamic entropy, and encoded by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Collective behaviour of the metabolic units that comprise organic matter is described by the statistical parameter evolutionary entropy, and encoded by the Entropic Principle of Evolution: Evolutionary entropy increases in systems driven by a stable energy source, and decreases in systems driven by a fluctuating energy source.
The relation between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Entropic Principle of Evolution will be described.
The origin of cellular life can be described in terms of the transition from inorganic matter to cooperative assemblies of organic matter. The implications of the Second Law and the Entropic Principle for the emergence of cellular life will be delineated.

2. Ask about page 51 on *Molecular Dynamics Simulation* showing notes written on Zotero.
